# Host Training – “Check-In & Seat Assignment” (Video Script ~60–90s)

## Purpose
Show new Hosts how to greet, check in, assign seats, and set expectations.

## Narration script (VO)
**Scene 1 – Host stand, calm morning.**
“At Co.work.PLAY Café, the Host is the first point of contact. Your job is to welcome caregivers, check them in quickly, and set them up for a focused, stress-free visit.”

**Scene 2 – Close-up of Host tablet showing Dashboard.**
“When a member arrives, tap ‘Check in member or guest’. Search by name, email, or phone, and confirm their membership is active.”

**Scene 3 – Screen capture: Member profile + Assign Seat button.**
“Ask about their preference: quiet, open workspace, or closer to the play area. Then tap ‘Assign Seat’ to open the seat map.”

**Scene 4 – Seat map overlay, Host tapping an available seat.**
“Choose a green, available seat in the right zone. Set an expected duration, and confirm. The system creates a seat session so we know who is sitting where.”

**Scene 5 – Host walking member to their seat, pointing to the seat label & QR code.**
“At the desk, point out the seat label, like A-12, and the QR code. Explain how ordering works:”

**Scene 6 – Close-up of Host talking to member.**
“Say: ‘Scan this QR code to sign in at your seat. You can order food and drinks from here, and we’ll bring everything to you. No need to stand in line.’”

**Scene 7 – Host back at the stand, quick shot of dashboard with multiple active sessions.**
“Throughout the day, you can move seats, extend sessions, or end them from the Host Console. Clear, calm communication keeps families confident and the workspace running smoothly.”

60–90 second training video inside a modern cowork + café + play space. A friendly Host at a branded front desk uses a tablet to check in a caregiver with a toddler, assigns a seat on a simple digital floorplan, then walks them to a workstation labeled “A-12” with a QR code. Soft camera moves, screen overlays showing the Host Console UI, and clear close-ups of seat labels and QR codes. Warm, bright lighting, calm background sound.
