# Host Intro 01 — Welcome & Enrollment Basics

## Narration
- “Welcome to Co.work.PLAY Café. As a Host, you’re the first smile families see. Start by greeting warmly and confirming their visit type.”
- “Scan or issue wristbands/QRs so every adult and child is linked. Remind guests about our 24-hour non-sick policy and socks in play zones.”
- “Offer a quick tour if they’re new: show play zones, café, and cowork areas. Highlight that an authorized adult must stay on-site.”
- “Explain membership options, including prepaid savings and sibling add-ons. If they’re not ready, invite them to try a day pass.”
- “Close with a clear next step: ‘I can start your membership now or set a follow-up. How can I make today easy?’”
