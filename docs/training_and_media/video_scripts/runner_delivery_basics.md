# Runner Training – “Delivering Orders to Seats” (Video Script ~45–60s)

## Narration
**Scene 1 – Cafe counter, Runner picks up a tray.**
“As a Runner, your role is to safely and accurately deliver orders from the cafe to each member’s assigned seat.”

**Scene 2 – Close-up: KDS screen showing ‘Seat A-12 – Alexander Warren London’.**
“Check the label on each ticket. It should clearly show the seat code, like ‘Seat A-12’, and the member’s name.”

**Scene 3 – Runner placing items on tray, checking stability.**
“Place all items on a tray so they’re stable and easy to carry, especially hot drinks.”

**Scene 4 – Over-the-shoulder shot: Runner walking along clear lane past cowork tables.**
“Use the main delivery lanes to reach the right seat. Avoid cutting through the play area or between closely spaced chairs.”

**Scene 5 – Runner arriving at seat, confirming name/seat.**
“At the desk, confirm: ‘Hi Alexander Warren London, latte and snack box for Seat A-12?’ Then place the items within easy reach.”

**Scene 6 – Close-up: Runner marking order delivered on a small tablet.**
“Finally, mark the order as Delivered in the system so the member’s app updates and the cafe team knows the delivery is complete.”

**Scene 7 – Runner walking back with empty tray, background of families working/playing.**
“Clear communication and careful movement keep the space calm and safe for both caregivers and kids.”
