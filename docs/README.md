# Documentation hub

Use this page as the orientation map for Co.work.PLAY Cafe. It links every canonical document, points to legacy/deprecated folders, and creates side doors between topics so you can navigate Wikipedia-style instead of drilling linearly.

- **Status key:** `[READY]` production-ready, `[IN PROGRESS]` partially complete, `[DRAFT]` early outline/reference.
- **Legacy note:** Prefer the numbered folders below. Former alias folders have been folded into the canonical sections and cataloged in [Deprecations](#deprecations-and-legacy-folders).
- **Roadmap:** See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for chronological status updates and work-in-flight.
