# Cafe Operator SOP – Receiving & Preparing Seat Orders

## Purpose
Keep seat orders flowing smoothly through POS → prep → runner handoff.

## A. Start-of-Shift Checklist
- Confirm POS & KDS are online.
- Verify a test order (internal) appears properly with seat code.
- Prepare staging area:
  - One small area labeled “Seat Orders”.
  - Tray space for multiple orders.

## B. Order Handling
1. New seat order appears (POS/KDS): shows items + “Seat A-12 – Alexander Warren London”.
2. Prep items as normal following cafe recipes and standards.
3. When order is complete:
   - Place all items on a tray in “Seat Orders” area.
   - Tap Ready / “Out for delivery” in KDS.
   - Let Runner know verbally or via app if system supports it.

## C. Issues
- **If POS connection lost:** Notify Host: “We’re not seeing new seat orders; please pause seat ordering until we’re back online.”
- **If inventory out:** Update menu (out-of-stock) and inform Host in case members ask.
