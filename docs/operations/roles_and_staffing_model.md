# Roles and Staffing Model

Baseline staffing expectations by role and daypart for the flagship format; adjust by unit size and seasonality.

## Roles
- **Host:** Greets, manages check-in/out, wristbands, membership questions, and safety reminders at entry.
- **Play Attendant:** Monitors play zones, enforces safety rules, manages “dirty toy” station, supports incident response.
- **Café Operator:** Preps and serves beverages/food, manages food safety logs, handles café POS.
- **Runner/Service Runner:** Picks up café orders, delivers to seats by seat code, keeps delivery lanes clear, and coordinates with host/café on seat issues.
- **Party Captain:** Sets up, hosts, and resets parties; coordinates with café for food and with attendants for activities.
- **Manager/Shift Lead:** Oversees floor, handles escalations, cash controls, staffing adjustments, and guest recovery.
- **Enrollment Attaché (Phase 1):** Savannah-style role focused on tours, enrollment closes, and follow-up with prospects.

## Staffing Ratios by Daypart (Flagship Reference)
- **Weekday mornings:** 1 Host, 2 Play Attendants, 1 Café Operator, 1 Manager/Lead; Enrollment Attaché on tour-heavy days.
- **Weekday afternoons:** 1 Host, 3 Play Attendants (add under-2 coverage), 1 Café Operator, 1 Manager/Lead, Enrollment Attaché during peak tours.
- **Evenings:** 1 Host, 2 Play Attendants, 1 Café Operator (light menu), shared Manager/Lead.
- **Weekends:** 1–2 Hosts (depending on parties), 3–4 Play Attendants, 2 Café Operators, 1 Manager/Lead, 1 Party Captain (add second during dual parties).

## Cross-Training & Relief
- Hosts cross-train on café runner tasks during rushes; play attendants trained to cover host breaks with manager oversight.
- Relief pool planned for vacations/illness; budget 10–12% over base hours for coverage and training.

## Scheduling Notes
- Build schedules around party bookings and camp/class blocks; ensure setup/tear-down coverage.
- Layer Enrollment Attaché around new member tours, corporate HR visits, and local events.
- Track labor-to-revenue weekly; adjust staffing to stay within target labor % while preserving safety ratios.
