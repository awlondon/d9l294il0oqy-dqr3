# Play Attendant SOP – Floor Coverage

## Purpose
Provide quick guidance for play attendants on monitoring safety, supporting families, and responding to incidents.

## Core Duties
- Greet families entering play zones and remind them of socks/wellness rules as needed.
- Monitor play areas for roughhousing, unsafe climbing, or toy misuse; redirect gently.
- Keep “dirty toy” bins moving to cleaning; restock high-demand toys and materials.
- Escalate wellness or behavior concerns to the Host or Manager promptly.

### Space & Zones Reference

Play attendants should be familiar with the intended layout and use of each area within the toddler play room (climb/slide zone, pretend play zone, activity tables, reading/calm corner, and under-2/sensory room). The design narrative and program for this room are documented in:

- [Toddler Play Area – Design Program & Narrative](../design/toddler_play_area_program.md)

Staff training should reinforce how each zone is meant to function so that toys, activities, and supervision strategies match the layout and age range.

## Groups with a Shared Caregiver

- If you see one caregiver watching several children, assume they are the caregiver of record for that group and address them first for behavior, safety, or wellness issues.
- If you believe one caregiver is overwhelmed by the number or needs of the children:
  - Notify the Host or Manager.
  - They may ask for an additional adult or suggest limiting the number of children in the play area at one time.
- Do not accept responsibility for supervising a group of children without a designated caregiver present on site.
