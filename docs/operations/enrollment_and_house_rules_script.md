# Enrollment and House Rules Script

Savannah’s live script for onboarding new members during tours and first visits.

## Opening
- “Welcome to Co.work.PLAY Café! I’m here to show you around and answer anything about memberships or day passes.”
- Confirm household makeup (number/ages of kids, work needs) to tailor the tour.

## What You Can Expect from Us
- Safe, clean play zones with attendants monitoring ratios and the “dirty toy” station.
- Café with member discounts and fast mobile ordering; plenty of outlets and Wi-Fi for work.
- Staff who will redirect unsafe behavior and keep the space calm and family-friendly.

## What We Ask from You
- Keep an authorized adult on-site; socks in play areas; food stays in café/approved zones.
- Follow the 24-hour non-sick policy; let us know if a toy or surface needs cleaning.
- Be kind to staff and other families; we’ll step in if play gets rough or unsafe.

## Membership Highlights
- Membership types and pricing, including prepaid options and sibling add-ons.
- Check-in with matching wristbands/QRs; authorized adults only for pick-up.
- Cancellation and pause basics: cancel before next billing date; pauses available for moves/health.

## Handling Issues
- “If something isn’t right, please tell me or the manager immediately—we want to fix it on the spot.”
- Briefly explain escalation steps for safety/behavior concerns and how incident notes are logged.

## Closing
- “Ready to try us out? We can start a membership or day pass now. I’ll send you a follow-up with today’s highlights.”
- Capture preferred contact method and send digital brochure/house rules after the tour.

## Workstation & Ordering Talking Points for New Members
- “You’ll be assigned a workstation with a code like A-12.”
- “You can order food and drinks from your seat using your phone or the screen at your station; we’ll bring it to you.”
- Frame tech extras (robots, AI) as future possibilities, not launch promises.
