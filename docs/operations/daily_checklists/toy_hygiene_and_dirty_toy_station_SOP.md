# Toy Hygiene and “Dirty Toy” Station SOP

## Station Setup
- Place lined “dirty toy” bins in each play zone and at the exit; label clearly for parents/staff.
- Stock sanitizer spray, wipes, gloves, and drying racks in the back-of-house cleaning area.
- Post quick instructions for staff on bin pickup times.

## Collection & Frequency
- Hosts/play attendants check bins at least every 60 minutes or immediately after spills/illness.
- Use gloves when handling soiled toys; separate heavily soiled items for pre-rinse.
- Log bin pickups and any incident-related items in the cleaning log.

## Cleaning Process
1. Pre-rinse or wipe visible soil; discard items that cannot be safely sanitized.
2. Apply approved disinfectant per dwell time; for plastics, use spray/wipe; for fabric/soft items, follow laundry protocol.
3. Rinse and dry thoroughly; avoid pooling water inside hollow toys.
4. Inspect for damage; retire cracked or loose-part items.

## Return to Service
- Place sanitized toys on drying racks until fully dry; then return to appropriate zone bins.
- Refresh liners in “dirty toy” bins and restock wipes/spray as needed.
- Note completion time and any discarded items in the log for inventory tracking.
