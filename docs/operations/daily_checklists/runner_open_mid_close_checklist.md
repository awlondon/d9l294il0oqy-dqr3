# Runner / Service Runner Open-Mid-Close Checklist

## Open
- Walk lanes and aisles to confirm they are clear of obstacles; note any floor hazards to the manager.
- Spot-check seat signage and QR visibility along delivery paths.
- Sync with host and cafe on seat map changes and allergy/party notes.

## Mid-Shift
- Verify seat signs stay visible after resets or moves; request replacements if damaged.
- Confirm orders picked up match seat codes on KDS labels before leaving the cafe.
- Communicate delays or hard-to-find seats to host/manager; keep guests updated when rerouting.

## Close
- Return delivery carts/trays; wipe down and store runners’ gear.
- Report any seat signage or lane issues for overnight fix.
- Debrief with cafe and host on any delivery misses to adjust maps or signage.
