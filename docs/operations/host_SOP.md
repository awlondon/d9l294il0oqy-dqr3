# Host SOP – Check-In & Seat Assignment

## Purpose
Make sure every member/guest is checked in, assigned a seat, and understands seat-based ordering.

## Who
Host (or Manager covering Host).

## A. Start-of-Shift Checklist
- Log into Host Console (tablet).
- Verify time/date are correct.
- Confirm internet connection is stable.
- Open the seat map and confirm all seat codes (A-01, A-02…) are visible and match physical labels.
- Walk the cowork area and ensure each workstation has:
  - A clear seat label (A-12, etc.).
  - A visible QR code sign ("Scan to order from this seat").
  - Replace any missing or damaged signs.
- Check with the café that KDS / POS are online and receiving test orders.

## B. Standard Check-In Flow – Member
### Greet
“Hi, welcome to Co.work.PLAY! Are you checking in as a member or day-pass guest today?”

### If member
1. Tap “Check in member or guest” → Member tab.
2. Search by name/email/phone and select the correct member.
3. Confirm:
   - Membership status = Active.
   - Children present today (names/ages).
4. Tap **Assign Seat**.

### Seat Assignment
- Ask: “Do you prefer quiet, open workspace, or a spot closer to the play area?”
- On Seat Map, choose seat based on preference (green = available).
- Set expected duration (e.g., 3 hours).
- Confirm seat: “You’re at Seat A-12 until about 12:30.”

### Explain seat + ordering
“At your seat you’ll see a sign with ‘Seat A-12’ and a QR code. Scan it to sign in and you can order food and drinks from your seat. We’ll bring everything to you.”

### Confirm play area rules quickly
- Socks, wellness policy, supervision basics.

### End
“If you need a different seat later or want to extend your time, just come back to me or tap the front desk button in the app.”

1. Select **Guest / Day Pass** tab.
2. Collect:

4. Tap **Continue to Seat Assignment**, and follow the same seat assignment + orientation steps as members.

## D. Session Management (during the day)
### Move seat
- If a guest requests: Open Session → **Move to a different seat** → choose new seat → confirm.

### End session
- When member leaves or at end of time: Open Session → **End session**.
