# Franchise Model Overview

The Phoenix flagship serves as the IP and training hub. Franchising targets cities with strong family demographics and remote/hybrid workforces across the U.S. and other English-speaking markets. Multiple store sizes (compact urban, neighborhood, flagship) allow right-sizing to real estate conditions while maintaining the core café + supervised play experience.
