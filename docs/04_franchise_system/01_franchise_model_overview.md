# Franchise Model Overview – Co.work.play Café

## 1. Strategic Role of Franchising

The long-term value of Co.work.play lies in:

- **Brand + IP** – a tested concept for remote-first families.
- **Playbook** – proven layouts, staffing models, membership structures.
- **Training system** – video-based modules and digital ops manuals.

The **Phoenix flagship** is the prototype and training hub. Franchising allows rapid expansion without the brand owning every store.

## 2. Franchise Formats

We plan to standardize three primary format templates:

1. **Neighborhood Co.work.play (5–6k SF)**
   - Located in family-heavy, car-oriented neighborhoods.
   - Strong play and café components; leaner cowork.

2. **Urban Compact (4–5k SF)**
   - High-density urban or inner-ring locations.
   - Emphasis on cowork and short-session play; smaller party room.

3. **Destination Flagship (8–9k SF)**
   - Larger regional centers or premium neighborhoods.
   - Full program (café, extensive play, cowork, party room) – based on Phoenix flagship.

Each format will have a defined program, capacity, and indicative CapEx range.

**Adaptable modules across formats**

- **Play:** Core play hall, infant/toddler zones, and modular party room that can flex into overflow weekend seating.
- **Cowork:** Mix of open seating and reservable phone booths or micro offices; add lounge zones for smaller footprints.
- **Café:** Counter-service espresso bar with speed-line items; small kitchens focus on reheating/assembly for consistency across franchisees.
- **Support spaces:** Family restrooms with changing tables, janitorial and trash staging, office/storage sized to fit format.
- **Safety and security:** Controlled entries to play zones, camera coverage for public areas, and defined egress/ADA clearances baked into every template.

## 3. Franchisor & Franchisee Roles

**Franchisor (Co.work.play HQ)**

- Provides:
  - Brand, trademarks, and visual identity.
  - Site selection criteria and review support.
  - Standardized design guidelines and template layouts.
  - Operations manuals and SOPs.
  - Training modules (video + documents).
  - Ongoing support and performance coaching.

**Franchisee**

- Provides:
  - Capital (build-out, working capital).
  - Day-to-day operations.
  - Local marketing and community building.
  - Adherence to brand standards and reporting.

**Performance cadence and accountability**

- Weekly KPI pulse calls (labor %, revenue mix, memberships, NPS) for the first 90 days post-opening; shifts to monthly thereafter.
- Quarterly business reviews covering brand compliance, staffing bench strength, maintenance, and local marketing calendar.
- Annual planning: budget submission, capital refresh schedule, and regional cluster strategy for multi-unit franchisees.
- Compliance: audit window of at least once per year; failure triggers corrective action plans and re-training requirements.

## 4. Revenue to Franchisor

## 5. Franchisee Economics (High Level)

- Build-out and equipment cost varies with format and market.  
- Revenue comes from:
  - Memberships and day passes.
  - Café sales.
  - Parties, events, and classes.
  - Room rentals (meeting pods, private nursing rooms during events).
  - Camps or seasonal programming (where licensing permits).

Franchisee targets:

- Reasonable payback period (e.g., 3–5 years) under typical assumptions.
- Clear path to multi-unit ownership for high performers.

Key levers:

- Pre-sales goal of ~150 founding memberships and booked parties before opening to smooth cash ramp.
- Labor as the controllable cost center—cross-train host/play/café hybrid roles and align staffing to real-time demand.
- Pricing discipline: periodic HQ-led reviews to align with inflation, competitive set, and brand positioning.

## 6. Standardization & Local Flex

The system balances:

- **Standard elements**:
  - Core brand, service standards, training modules.
  - Layout logic and safety practices.
  - Membership framework and policies.

- **Local adaptation**:
  - Menu adjustments to local tastes.
  - Slight shifts in play equipment mix.
  - Locally relevant events and partnerships.

The flagship serves as the baseline; learnings there inform the franchise package.
