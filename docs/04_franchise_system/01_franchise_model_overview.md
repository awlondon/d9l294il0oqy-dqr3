# Franchise Model Overview – Co.work.play Café

## 1. Strategic Role of Franchising

The long-term value of Co.work.play lies in:

- **Brand + IP** – a tested concept for remote-first families.
- **Playbook** – proven layouts, staffing models, membership structures.
- **Training system** – video-based modules and digital ops manuals.

The **Phoenix flagship** is the prototype and training hub. Franchising allows rapid expansion without the brand owning every store.

## 2. Franchise Formats

We plan to standardize three primary format templates:

1. **Neighborhood Co.work.play (5–6k SF)**
   - Located in family-heavy, car-oriented neighborhoods.
   - Strong play and café components; leaner cowork.

2. **Urban Compact (4–5k SF)**
   - High-density urban or inner-ring locations.
   - Emphasis on cowork and short-session play; smaller party room.

3. **Destination Flagship (8–9k SF)**
   - Larger regional centers or premium neighborhoods.
   - Full program (café, extensive play, cowork, party room) – based on Phoenix flagship.

Each format will have a defined program, capacity, and indicative CapEx range.

Primary franchisor revenue streams (details in separate doc):

## 5. Franchisee Economics (High Level)

- Build-out and equipment cost varies with format and market.  
- Revenue comes from:
  - Memberships and day passes.
  - Café sales.
  - Parties, events, and classes.

Franchisee targets:

- Reasonable payback period (e.g., 3–5 years) under typical assumptions.
- Clear path to multi-unit ownership for high performers.

Detailed assumptions and scenarios live in:

## 6. Standardization & Local Flex

The system balances:

- **Standard elements**:
  - Core brand, service standards, training modules.
  - Layout logic and safety practices.
  - Membership framework and policies.

- **Local adaptation**:
  - Menu adjustments to local tastes.
  - Slight shifts in play equipment mix.
  - Locally relevant events and partnerships.

The flagship serves as the baseline; learnings there inform the franchise package.
