# Investor Overview – One Pager

## Concept
Co.work.PLAY Cafe combines specialty coffee, flexible coworking, and supervised play under one roof. Parents get productive time; kids enjoy safe engagement. The Phoenix flagship proves the model and anchors a franchise rollout.

## Market
- Rising remote/hybrid workforce with childcare gaps.
- Scarcity of calm, design-forward family spaces; competitors silo cafe, cowork, and play.
- Target trade areas: high dual-income households, strong early-childhood populations, and employer stipend programs.

## Business Model
- Recurring memberships + day passes; strong cafe attach rate.
- Ancillary revenue: parties, classes/camps, meeting rooms, and retail.
- Franchise model: $50k initial fee; 6% royalty; 2% brand fund.

## Flagship Snapshot (Stabilized)
- ~8,500 SF; ~$3.0M annual revenue; ~$0.74M EBITDA (≈28%).
- CapEx target: ~$2.2M inclusive of contingency and pre-open working capital.
- Staffing: 1 host, 2–3 play, 2 cafe, 1 lead per peak daypart; strong cross-training.

## Traction & Roadmap
- Design program and training/SOPs in place; pre-sale and employer partnerships planned.
- Franchise prototype defined for 4–9k SF footprints; medium format modeled at ~$1.98M annual revenue with 22–28% EBITDA.
- Pipeline focus: Phoenix metro expansion, then regional clusters in family-dense markets.

## Why Now
- Employers subsidizing caregiver support; parents seeking reliable third places.
- Few integrated concepts with both hospitality quality and safety rigor.
