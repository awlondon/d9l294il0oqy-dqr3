# Five-Year Financial & Strategic Plan

## Purpose
Provide a concise five-year roadmap for Co.work.play Café, combining unit-level economics with the expansion cadence needed to reach multi-region scale while managing capital intensity.

## Expansion Roadmap (Years 1–5)
- **Regional growth model:** Start with a Phoenix flagship as the proof-of-concept and training hub, cluster nearby locations to refine operations, then replicate the format across additional regions.
- **Year 1:** Open flagship (90–100% build-out quality) and one nearby city location; stabilize memberships/day passes and test revenue splits.
- **Year 2:** Add 2–3 additional outlets in the metro (total 4–5); deepen brand marketing and AI/GM engagement playbooks.
- **Year 3:** Enter a new region/state with 1–2 openings; drive existing units toward 60–70%+ occupancy to approach breakeven.
- **Years 4–5:** Scale to ~10–20 total locations across 3–4 regions via a mix of corporate and franchise/partnership deals; Year 5 includes an international pilot (e.g., Canada or Europe) to validate cross-border viability.

## Unit CAPEX (3,000–5,000 SF Prototype)
- **Leasehold improvements:** ~$150–$200 per SF; a 4,000 SF site ranges ~$600K–$800K.
- **Café/kitchen equipment:** ~$200K for espresso/brewing/blending gear plus $50K–$100K for ovens, refrigeration, and dish.
- **Play equipment:** $30K–$50K for commercial toddler play modules, mats, and sensory items.
- **AI-GM hardware:** $10K–$20K for displays (3–5 screens), media players/mini-PCs, sensors, and mounts.
- **FF&E:** $50K–$100K for seating, café bar, conference furnishings, fixtures, and décor.
- **Build-out labor & soft costs:** $150K–$250K for contractor fees, permits, design, signage, and contingency.
- **Total per unit:** ~$1.0–$1.5M depending on finish level and shell condition.

## Unit OPEX (Annual)
- **Staffing:** ~$180K–$300K (10–15 staff across café, play area, and community management).
- **Rent:** ~$240K/year assuming ~$5/SF/month on 4,000 SF urban retail.
- **Utilities:** ~$40K/year (electric, water, gas, internet).
- **Maintenance & security:** $12K–$36K/year for cleaning, sanitization, repairs, and monitoring.
- **Software/AI:** ~$5K–$10K/year for AI/model usage plus <$1K/year for digital signage licensing (~4 screens).
- **Insurance & permits:** ~$6K–$13K/year for liability/property/worker’s comp plus food/amusement permits.

## Revenue Model & Margin Targets
- **Coworking:** ~$6–$13 per SF/month; at 4,000 SF this implies ~$288K–$624K/year at high occupancy. Breakeven typically requires 60–70% utilization.
- **Café:** ~$300–$800 per SF/year on ~1,000 SF café zone; ~$300K–$800K/year at maturity. Gross margin ~60%; net EBITDA margin ~15%.
- **Party/Event rentals:** $500–$1,500 per event; 10 events/month at $1,000 adds ~$120K/year of high-margin revenue.
- **Blended yield:** Combined coworking + café can target ~$500–$800 per SF/year (~$2.0–3.2M/year at full capture on 4,000 SF).
- **Net margin:** System-level net margin expected in the 10–15% range once stabilized, with upside to 20%+ at mature, high-occupancy units.

## Cash Flow & Payback
- **Ramp:** Early-year revenue may start near ~$500K per unit and grow toward ~$800K+ by Year 2 as occupancy climbs.
- **Breakeven:** Expect 12–18 months to reach 60–70% utilization and approach breakeven; cumulative payback in ~3–5 years per unit.
- **Scale benefits:** At 10–20 units by Year 5, centralized purchasing, shared AI licensing, and franchising/lighter corporate capex improve cash conversion.

## Capital Strategy
- **Franchising & partnerships:** Use franchise/partnership deals to defray capex while preserving brand control; co-invest selectively in early multi-unit deals.
- **Flagship playbook:** Use Phoenix as the operational and AI-GM training hub; document a repeatable build kit, vendor list, and SOP stack to shorten time-to-open.
- **Format flexibility:** Maintain a core 3,000–5,000 SF inline/box prototype with options for smaller satellites near offices and larger family-focused footprints in suburban centers.
- **Funding sources:** Blend equity for initial corporate units with equipment financing and potential landlord TI contributions; franchise fees and royalties fund franchisor overhead.

## International Pilot (Year 5)
- **Localization:** Translate AI-GM voice/text prompts and adapt cultural tone (e.g., birthday announcements, safety messaging).
- **Regulation:** Comply with ASTM standards in the US and EN 1176/1177 (or local equivalents) abroad; align food, labor, and child-to-staff ratios with local laws.
- **Cultural fit:** Adjust play design and supervision policies to local expectations (e.g., more enclosed toddler areas or higher attendant ratios where norms demand).

## KPIs & Governance
- Time-to-open (LOI to doors): target <9 months; variance tracked by site.
- Occupancy: 60–70% utilization by month 12; path to 80%+ in mature sites.
- Membership conversion: >18% of day-pass visitors.
- EBITDA margin: 10–15% at stabilization; 20%+ stretch at mature units.
- NPS: >55 across system; quarterly brand compliance audits for franchisees.

## Risk Watchlist
- **Occupancy risk:** Mitigation via local marketing, employer partnerships, and community events to drive early desk adoption.
- **Capex creep:** Guardrails through standardized design kit, value-engineered finishes, and landlord TI negotiations.
- **Labor variability:** Cross-train café/play/community roles; monitor wage inflation by market.
- **Regulatory drift:** Periodic reviews of childcare, food, and accessibility codes per region; local counsel for international pilots.
- **Technology adoption:** Ensure AI-GM reliability and clear staff training; maintain privacy-by-design practices for sensors/cameras.
