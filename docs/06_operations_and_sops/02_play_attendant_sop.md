# Play Attendant SOP

## Opening Responsibilities
- Perform safety checks on play equipment, padding, gate latches, and wall/floor anchors; remove or tag any unsafe items.
- Set up age-zoned activities (sensory bins, fine-motor toys, gross-motor stations) and ensure visibility from the attendant post.
- Review incident log and handoff notes from prior shift; confirm radios and spill/first-aid kits are stocked.

## Active Coverage
- Maintain line-of-sight coverage across zones; rotate positioning to cover blind spots and stroller traffic.
- Enforce age-appropriate play and gentle behavior; redirect with positive language and offer alternative activities.
- Monitor allergen-sensitive stations and keep food/drinks out of play surfaces except designated snack tables.
- Capture quick resets between groups: wipe down high-touch toys, sort loose pieces, and remove trip hazards.
- Communicate with hosts and café when capacity thresholds are reached; manage waitlists and timed sessions if needed.

## Parent Communication & Service Recovery
- Greet parents on entry to explain rules, exits, and how to reach attendants; offer quick tours for new members.
- Log incidents (bumps, spills, behavior issues) and brief parents promptly; escalate injuries per emergency protocol.
- Provide service recovery options for disrupted visits (drink vouchers, re-booked play sessions) per manager guidance.

## Closing Duties
- Run the end-of-day checklist with another team member: deep clean soft goods, sanitize toys, and reset age bins.
- Document equipment pulled from service with photos/notes; place clear signage until repaired or replaced.
- Close the incident log, noting follow-ups required for the next shift or manager review.
