# Cleaning and Safety Checklists

## Opening (Pre-Guest)
- Walk the entire floor to identify spills, obstructions, or tripping hazards; correct before unlocking doors.
- Sanitize entry touchpoints, POS terminals, high chairs, and stroller parking handles.
- Disinfect play equipment touch surfaces (rails, slides, handles) and rotate soft toys that need laundering.
- Verify diaper pails are empty, liners are in place, and handwashing sinks are stocked with soap and towels.
- Confirm first-aid kit, AED (if installed), and spill kits are stocked and accessible.

## Mid-Day (Hourly or Between Sessions)
- Wipe café tables, cowork desks, and play surfaces with food-safe sanitizer; allow dwell time.
- Spot-vacuum or sweep high-crumb and sand/bean table areas; check for loose parts or broken toys.
- Restock wipes, diapers (if provided), gloves, and sanitizer at changing stations and play attendant posts.
- Empty trash/diaper pails before they overflow; tie off and transport to the BOH waste area.
- Log any safety issues (loose hardware, frayed cords, lifted flooring) and tag equipment out of service if needed.

## Closing
- Deep clean café bar surfaces, espresso steam wands, and drip trays per café SOP; run cleaning cycles.
- Mop all hard floors with kid-safe solution; disinfect bathroom fixtures, sinks, and door hardware.
- Launder or bag for laundering: soft play items, bibs, aprons, and rags; restock fresh linens.
- Reset play zones with age-appropriate toys; remove broken or missing pieces and note for reorder.
- Secure entrances/exits, check emergency lighting, and empty all trash/diaper pails to exterior bins.

## Weekly
- Disassemble and sanitize large play structures (foam blocks, climbers) and deep clean soft goods.
- Inspect and tighten hardware on play equipment; check wall/floor anchors and document corrections.
- Test emergency exits, alarms, and first-aid/AED components; log results and deficiencies.
- Clean HVAC vents/intakes in guest areas and dust light fixtures within reach.

## Monthly
- Conduct a full safety walkthrough with the manager: review incident logs, trends, and mitigation steps.
- Replace or launder seat cushions and machine-wash removable covers; spot-treat upholstery as needed.
- Review chemical storage for correct labeling and SDS availability; retrain staff on PPE if gaps are found.
- Verify pest-prevention measures (sealed food bins, drains treated) and schedule service if issues appear.

## Documentation & Supplies
- Maintain a digital or printed checklist for each shift; require initials and timestamps for critical items.
- Keep Safety Data Sheets (SDS) accessible near cleaning supplies and review during onboarding.
- Store chemicals away from play areas and never mix solutions; use gloves and eye protection when required.
- Update the maintenance log when equipment is pulled from service; include photos for franchise reporting.
