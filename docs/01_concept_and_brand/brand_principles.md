# Brand Principles

## Purpose
Define the personality, tone, and experiential standards that keep Co.work.play Café consistent across the flagship and all franchise locations.

## Positioning Statement
A warm-modern, hospitality-first café and cowork space where parents can be productive while children are engaged in safe, joyful play.

## Tone of Voice
- **Warm and competent:** Friendly without baby talk; confident without jargon.
- **Clear and calm:** Short sentences, direct instructions, and reassuring phrasing during check-in and safety moments.
- **Inclusive and modern:** Welcome all family structures and abilities; avoid gendered or exclusive language.
- **Playful restraint:** Delight through small moments (stickers, latte art, kids’ names on cubbies) without clutter or chaos.

## Visual & Environmental Cues
- **Palette:** Soft neutrals with warm wood, balanced by muted blues/greens; accent color used sparingly for wayfinding.
- **Materials:** Durable laminates, wipeable fabrics, rounded edges, acoustic felt, and greenery for biophilic comfort.
- **Lighting:** Layered—ambient for warmth, task lighting at workstations, dimmable party/event settings.
- **Sound:** Acoustic separation between café/cowork and play; white noise and soft music to keep energy even.

## Experience Promises
- **Predictable cleanliness:** Visible checklists, scent-neutral cleaning, and tidy sightlines from entry.
- **Staff presence:** Hosts greet within 10 seconds; play attendants introduce themselves and review safety rules.
- **Speed with care:** Under-3 minute café ticket times for core beverages during peak windows; proactive table touches.
- **Safety-first:** Secure check-in/check-out, wristbands or tags, headcounts every 30 minutes, and documented incident response.

## Signature Moments
- Welcome board listing today’s classes and party schedule.
- “Focus ready” trays (outlets, sanitizer, water carafes) placed in cowork areas each morning.
- “Play warm-up” routine at the top of each hour to reset toys and re-brief kids.
- Members-only perks: drink discounts, early booking windows, and surprise mini-treats for children.

## Guardrails for Franchisees
- Keep circulation clear: stroller parking zones marked and enforced.
- Avoid over-theming; favor timeless finishes over characters or licensed décor.
- Maintain sightlines from host stand to play entry; never obstruct with merchandise.
- Train to scripts; ad-lib only after the core safety and hospitality phrases are mastered.
