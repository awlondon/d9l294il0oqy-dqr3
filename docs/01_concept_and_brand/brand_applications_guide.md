# Co.work.PLAY Café Brand Applications Guide

## Exterior Signage
- Use the **primary horizontal lockup** in full color where permitted; opt for one-color or reversed white for darker façades or backlit signs.
- Prioritize legibility from street distance: maintain clear space (height of the “P”) and avoid thin materials that reduce stroke clarity.
- For franchises, document preferred placements, illumination (halo/backlit where possible), and materials in signage mockups stored under `/media/branding/mockups/`.

## Interior Branding
- Apply the logo on welcome walls and reception desks using the primary lockup; scale to maintain the minimum size and clear space rules.
- In cowork areas, lean on neutrals and the “Co.work.” tone; in play zones, use the PLAY colors sparingly on wall graphics and wayfinding.
- Use small applications (door vinyl, window frosting, directional signage) with one-color or reversed logos to keep interiors cohesive.

## Merchandise
- Default to one-color or full-color logos depending on material: white mugs or totes can host the full-color mark; darker fabrics benefit from the reversed white version.
- Maintain the assigned PLAY letter colors on multicolor prints; never recolor letters for production convenience without approval.
- Store mockups and print-ready layouts in `/media/branding/mockups/`; final vendor-ready art belongs in `/media/branding/logo_master/` and `/media/branding/logo_raster/`.

## Digital
- Website header: use the primary horizontal lockup sized for 120 px+ width with ample padding; ensure contrast against nav backgrounds.
- Social media avatars: use an abbreviated mark (e.g., PLAY letters contained or a tightened “Co.work.PLAY”) saved to `/media/branding/logo_raster/`.
- Email and presentation templates should rely on the Neutral Dark + accent palette, reserving PLAY colors for sparing highlights.

## File Placement Notes
- **Vector masters:** `/media/branding/logo_master/` (AI, PDF, SVG) for primary and stacked lockups.
- **Raster exports:** `/media/branding/logo_raster/` (PNG, JPG) for web and office use.
- **Mockups:** `/media/branding/mockups/` for signage, merch, and digital previews linked within presentations.
