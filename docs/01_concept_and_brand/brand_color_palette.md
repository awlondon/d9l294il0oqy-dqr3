## Usage Notes
- The PLAY colors are primarily reserved for the logo wordmark and select kid-facing accents (e.g., play-zone signage or stickers).
- Avoid using all four PLAY colors at once in UI or dense print layouts; pair them with **Neutral Dark** and ample white space.
- For accessibility, ensure sufficient contrast when placing brights on light backgrounds; consider outlining letters in white when reversed on dark photography.
- CTA elements can use **Highlight Accent** sparingly to complement the PLAY colors without competing with them.
