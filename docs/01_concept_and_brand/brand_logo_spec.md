# Co.work.PLAY Cafe Logo Specification

For a narrative overview of the brand, see `brand_one_pager.md`.

## Logo Concept – Overview
The Co.work.PLAY Cafe logo is a **text-only wordmark** made of three coordinated parts:
- **“Co.work.”** signals a modern coworking experience with a technical, professional tone.
- **“PLAY”** introduces warmth and kid-friendly energy through rounded letters and individual bright colors inspired by Toys R Us without copying their shapes.
- **“Cafe”** adds an elegant hospitality note, softening the mark and making it approachable.

## Word Breakdown
### Co.work.
- **Typeface:** Modern, technical sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Roboto, Source Code Pro, Eurostile).

- **Color:** Neutral (black, very dark gray, or navy) to anchor the logo.

### PLAY
- **Typeface:** Bold, rounded display (e.g., Baloo, Fredoka One, Bouncy).

- **Color:** Neutral, typically matching “Co.work.” or a warm dark brown.

## Logo Lockups
### Primary Horizontal Lockup
- Single line: `Co.work.` + `PLAY` + `Cafe`.
- Keep balanced spacing so the “PLAY” block stays visually central.

### Stacked Lockup
- Top line: `Co.work.PLAY`
- Bottom line: `Cafe` centered beneath.
- Maintain the relative scale between lines; do not compress letter spacing.

> All lockups must preserve proportions and relative sizing across outputs.

- **One-Color:** Entire wordmark in black or white for limited-print or low-cost production.

## Clear Space & Minimum Size

- **Minimum sizes:**
  - Digital: Minimum 120 px wide for legibility.
  - Print: Minimum 25 mm wide for legibility.
