# Co.work.PLAY Café – Brand One-Pager

## Brand Essence
Co.work.PLAY Café is a hybrid coworking, supervised play, and specialty café destination that lets caregivers stay productive without losing sight of their kids. Brand promise: **Get real work done while your little ones play nearby, safely and joyfully.**

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Remote and hybrid parents—especially mothers—and other hands-on caregivers who need reliable workspace plus trusted supervision.
- **Secondary:** Local professionals who want a vibrant café workspace, employers offering memberships or stipends, and partners evaluating franchise opportunities.

## Brand Personality & Tone
- **Personality:** Warm and human, modern and competent, playful but not chaotic, safe and trustworthy, hospitality-forward.
- **Tone of voice:** Clear, kind, lightly witty; never cutesy or corporate-cold.

## Logo System (Wordmark)
- Three-part wordmark reads **Co.work.PLAY Café**.
- **Co.work.** — Technical modern sans-serif, outlined to cue coworking credibility.
- **PLAY** — Bold, rounded letters with subtle rotation and multicolored/gradient treatment to signal kid energy.
- **Café** — Elegant script with accented **é**, providing warmth and hospitality.
- Primary lockup is horizontal; a stacked lockup is secondary for tight spaces. Both retain proportions and spacing.

## Color & Typography (High-Level)
- **Core neutrals:** Deep charcoal, off-white, and café brown for grounding.
- **PLAY accents:** Raspberry, orange, green, and blue as the primary pops.
- **Typography:** Brand sans-serif for headlines, a legible sans or serif for body text, and script reserved for “Café” and minimal accent headings.

## Spatial & Experience Cues
- Quiet cowork areas lean on calm “Co.work.” neutrals and restrained accents.
- Café and social zones use warm neutrals with selective color to feel inviting but focused.
- Play zones (especially under-2) bring brighter “PLAY” language without visual chaos.
- Materials favor warm woods, soft upholstery, acoustic treatments, and durable surfaces that clean easily.

## Key Applications
- Exterior signage: fascia sign plus blade sign featuring the wordmark.
- Interior branding: reception wall, window vinyl, play-area graphics, and menu boards.
- Digital: website header, social avatars, and platform icons.
- Merchandise: mugs, totes, tees, aprons, and membership cards.
- All uses must preserve logo integrity—no stretching, recoloring, font swaps, or reordering.

## Design & Build Next Steps
- Finalize vector master of the logo (horizontal and stacked).
- Build a 10–15 page mini brand guide expanding on this one-pager.
- Hand off to architects/interior designers for signage and environmental graphics.
- Brief marketing on web, social, and launch templates; prepare franchise documentation for future locations.
