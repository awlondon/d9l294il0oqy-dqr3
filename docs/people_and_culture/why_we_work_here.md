# Why We Work Here

Co.work.PLAY Café is not meant to be a “last resort” job. The work is emotionally and physically real: kids, coffee, messes, emotions, and logistics all in the same building. That only works if people are here because they want to be.

We look for and try to create conditions where:

- Staff understand the mission: supporting caregivers and kids.
- Leaders communicate clearly and respectfully.
- Schedules and expectations are as predictable as possible.
- People feel safe speaking up when something isn’t working.

If someone consistently feels like they “have no choice” but to work here, something is wrong in our leadership, staffing model, or pay structure—and we treat that as a problem to solve, not a normal state of affairs.
