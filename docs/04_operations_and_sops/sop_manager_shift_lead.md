# SOP – Manager / Shift Lead

## Purpose
Provide daily leadership that keeps safety, hospitality, and financial performance on track.

## Scope
Applies to managers and shift leads overseeing operations at flagship and franchise locations.

## Responsibilities
- Run pre-shift huddles, set priorities, and assign positions.
- Monitor safety ratios, ticket times, and queue lengths; reallocate staff as needed.
- Approve comps/discounts, handle guest escalations, and ensure incident reporting.
- Oversee cash handling, deposits, inventory counts, and ordering cadence.
- Coach team members and verify training completion; maintain checklists and logs.

## Daily Routine
- **Pre-open:** Review bookings/parties, labor schedule, and maintenance tickets; run 10-minute huddle covering safety focus and promo of the day.
- **Active hours:**
  - Float between host/play/cafe; spot-check check-in accuracy and cafe quality.
  - Track KPIs: check-in wait time, cafe ticket time, headcounts, and cleanliness scores.
  - Support breaks and shift changes to maintain ratios.
- **Wrap:** Confirm checklists, reconcile cash, close POS batches, submit daily report (revenue mix, incidents, staffing notes).

## Procedures
1. **Incident Management**
   - Respond immediately to injuries, illness, or behavioral escalations; ensure documentation and parent communication.
   - For major events, call EMS, secure area, and notify Regional Support/franchisor.
2. **Service Recovery**
   - Use L.A.S.T. (Listen, Apologize, Solve, Thank); authorize comps within policy; record in feedback log.
3. **Labor Control**
   - Compare actual vs. scheduled every 2 hours; adjust staffing to maintain 30–34% labor target.
4. **Facilities & Safety**
   - Inspect for trip hazards, wet floors, malfunctioning equipment; lock/tag out unsafe items until resolved.

## Escalation Path
- Critical safety/medical: EMS → Regional Support/Owner immediately after stabilization.
- Technology outage: contact vendor hotline; deploy manual check-in/payment until restored.
- HR/behavior issues: document and escalate to Owner/HR partner.

## Metrics of Success
- KPI targets hit 80%+ of weeks (ticket times, labor %, safety compliance).
- 100% incident and checklist completion; zero unlogged headcounts.
- Positive guest recovery outcomes (issue closed same visit, high survey sentiment).
