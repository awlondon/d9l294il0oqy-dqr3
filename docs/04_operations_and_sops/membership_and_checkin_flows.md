# Membership and Check-In Flows

## Purpose
Document clear, repeatable flows for member and day-pass guests to reduce friction, protect safety, and drive conversion.

## Member Flow
1. **Arrival**
   - Host greets and scans member profile; confirms children on file and any notes/allergies.
   - Apply matching adult/child wristbands or tags; confirm visit end time if play capacity is limited.
2. **Orientation**
   - Remind of today’s classes/parties and available cowork seats; highlight café specials.
   - If under-2, review calmer play rules; if meeting room reserved, provide access code.
3. **During Visit**
   - Host monitors dwell; play attendant logs headcounts every 30 minutes.
   - Café applies automatic member discount; encourage pre-order via app for second drink.
4. **Extension/Bookings**
   - Offer add-on hour if capacity allows; prompt booking of next visit or party at checkout.
5. **Check-Out**
   - Match wristbands/tags; verify all children accounted for; ask for quick satisfaction rating.

## Day-Pass Flow
1. **Arrival & Waiver**
   - Host welcomes guest, explains concept; first-time visitors sign waiver (digital/paper backup).
2. **Payment & Timing**
   - Collect day-pass payment; set end time and communicate extension policy ($12/hr after first 2 hours).
3. **Orientation**
   - Review play rules, café options, and meeting room availability; suggest membership if visiting 2x/month.
4. **During Visit**
   - Track wristband colors for expiration; 10-minute warning before end time; offer membership conversion with crediting of day-pass fee if signed same day.
5. **Check-Out**
   - Remove wristbands/tags; thank guest; provide promo for next visit/founding membership if in pre-sale.

## Scripts & Prompts
- **Conversion prompt:** “If you plan to come twice this month, our membership saves you money and includes discounts on drinks and parties. Want me to set that up?”
- **Capacity hold:** “We’re at our safe play capacity; I’ll start your pass in 10 minutes. Feel free to grab a drink and I’ll text when your spot opens.”
- **Extension prompt:** “You have 20 minutes left—would you like to extend another hour for $12?”

## Exceptions & Offline Mode
- If POS/LMS down: use paper log for names, time, and tag numbers; process payments via backup terminal or manual entry later with receipt photo.
- If play is at capacity: hold check-ins, start a waitlist with timestamp and party size; prioritize members.

## Data & Reporting
- Track conversion: day-pass to membership within 30 days; target 18%.
- Monitor average dwell time by member type; adjust staffing accordingly.
- Weekly audit of wristband/tag inventory and color rotation.
