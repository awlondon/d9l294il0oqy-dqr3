# SOP – Play Attendant

## Purpose
Deliver safe, engaging play experiences while maintaining strict supervision standards.

## Scope
Applies to all play attendants overseeing the 2–5 zone and under-2 room during operating hours and events.

## Responsibilities
- Enforce safety rules, maintain ratios, and perform headcounts every 30 minutes.
- Lead hourly resets and light engagement (storytime, guided play) without over-structuring.
- Communicate allergies/notes from host to cafe and leadership when relevant.
- Inspect equipment daily and report maintenance needs.
- Support party setups and breakdowns as scheduled.

## Daily Routine
- **Pre-open:** Inspect play structure, mats, and gates; sanitize high-touch items; set signage; test radios.
- **Active hours:**
  - Greet families entering play; reiterate rules and safe behaviors.
  - Run headcounts and log them; document any incidents or near-misses immediately.
  - Rotate toys (STEM, imaginative, gross-motor) each hour for variety and cleanliness.
- **Wrap:** Deep sanitize toys/mats, lock storage, complete incident log, and brief next shift.

## Procedures
1. **Safety Rules to Communicate**
   - Socks required; no shoes on mats/structure.
   - No food/drink beyond cafe-safe zones; water bottles allowed in designated area.
   - Caregivers stay reachable; under-2 has stricter calm/no-running rules.
2. **Incident Response**
   - Minor (scrape/bump): Provide first-aid per training, log, and inform caregiver and Shift Lead.
   - Major (head injury, allergic reaction): Call Shift Lead immediately; initiate emergency protocol and EMS if needed.
3. **Lost Child Procedure**
   - Radio “Code Yellow” with last known location; lock exits; hosts verify tags; resume normal ops only after confirmation.
4. **Party Support**
   - Set up activity stations, manage timing, and lead clean handoffs to party captain.

## Escalation Path
- Equipment damage or safety hazards: Shift Lead → Manager → Facilities vendor.
- Behavior issues: Warn once, then escalate to Shift Lead for parent conversation.
- Over-capacity: Pause entries, inform Host to hold check-ins until safe ratio restored.

## Metrics of Success
- Headcount logs 100% completed; incident reports filed same-day.
- Cleanliness scores of play/under-2 >95% on audits.
- Positive parent feedback on attentiveness; minimal rule reminders per guest.
