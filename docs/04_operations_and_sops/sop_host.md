# SOP – Host

## Purpose
Ensure every guest receives a warm, efficient welcome and safe check-in/check-out experience.

## Scope
Applies to hosts at flagship and franchise locations during all operating hours.

## Responsibilities
- Greet guests within 10 seconds; manage queue and flow.
- Verify memberships/day passes, apply wristbands/tags, and explain rules.
- Manage reservations for meeting rooms and parties; coordinate with play attendants.
- Maintain lobby cleanliness, retail fronting, and stroller parking.
- Capture guest feedback and escalate issues to Shift Lead/Manager.

## Daily Routine
- **Pre-open:** Power on tablets/label printer; restock wristbands, stickers, and sanitizer; review schedule for parties/classes.
- **Active hours:**
  - Check-in: Confirm membership status, apply matching adult/child tags, review play rules, and note allergies.
  - Payment: Collect day-pass fees, add-on hours, or guest counts; process waivers if new.
  - Communication: Radio play attendants for headcounts; alert cafe of large groups.
- **Wrap:** Reconcile cash/receipts, tidy lobby, log lost-and-found.

## Procedures
1. **Check-In Script**
   - “Welcome to Co.work.PLAY! Are you a member or visiting today?”
   - For members: confirm identity, apply wristbands, remind of booking windows.
   - For day pass: process waiver, collect payment, set end time, and explain extension policy.
2. **Safety Verification**
   - Match adult/child tags; confirm authorized pickup names; highlight under-2 policies.
   - Deny entry for illness symptoms per health policy; offer reschedule.
3. **Check-Out**
   - Verify matching tags, confirm children accounted for, remove wristbands, and thank guests.
4. **Incident Escalation**
   - If injury or safety concern: notify Shift Lead, document in incident log, provide first-aid per training.

## Escalation Path
- Operational delays or long lines: notify Shift Lead for additional staffing.
- Safety/health incidents: Shift Lead → Manager → Regional Support.
- System outages: contact tech support; use paper backup forms and manual payments if required.

## Metrics of Success
- Check-in time <3 minutes; queue cleared within 5 minutes during peak.
- 0 mismatched tags; 100% waiver compliance for new guests.
- Positive greeting scores in post-visit surveys; lobby cleanliness audits >95%.
