# Staffing and Shift Structure

## Purpose
Define baseline roles, coverage by daypart, and responsibilities for the flagship and adaptable templates for franchisees.

## Roles & Brief Descriptions
- **Host:** Greets, checks in/out guests, manages wristbands/tags, monitors lobby and retail.
- **Play Attendant:** Oversees play and under-2 areas, enforces safety rules, runs hourly resets, leads minor programming.
- **Cafe Operator/Barista:** Executes beverage/food program, manages cafe seating cleanliness, supports catering for parties.
- **Party Captain (peak/weekend):** Runs party timeline, coordinates décor and F&B, manages guest counts.
- **Shift Lead:** Oversees floor, handles guest escalations, cash/comp approvals, and safety compliance.
- **Manager:** Scheduling, inventory, hiring, vendor relations, KPI review, and community partnerships.

## Baseline Coverage (Flagship)
| Daypart | Weekday Staffing | Weekend Staffing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Morning (7a–12p) | 1 Host, 2 Play Attendants, 2 Cafe, 1 Lead/Manager | 1 Host, 3 Play Attendants, 2 Cafe, 1 Lead |
| Midday (12p–5p) | 1 Host, 2 Play Attendants, 2 Cafe, 1 Lead | 1 Host, 3 Play Attendants, 2 Cafe, 1 Party Captain, 1 Lead |
| Evening (5p–9p) | 1 Host, 1–2 Play Attendants (program-dependent), 1–2 Cafe, 1 Lead | 1 Host, 2 Play Attendants, 2 Cafe, 1 Lead |

## Ratios & Policies
- Play area: 1 attendant per 12 children; under-2: 1 per 6 children.
- Leads/Managers must be present whenever play is open; only leads/managers handle incident reports.
- Cross-training encouraged: Hosts able to support cafe POS for peak lines; cafe staff trained on basic play safety checks.

## Scheduling Templates
- Build schedules two weeks in advance; lock week-of changes 72 hours prior.
- Include 15-minute overlap for shift handoffs; leads conduct safety/throughput huddles.
- Reserve 2 hours/week per team member for training and cleaning drills.

## Franchise Adaptation
- **Small format:** Remove party captain except during weekend blocks; host doubles as light retail when volume permits.
- **Medium format:** Mirrors flagship ratios with fewer cafe FTEs; manager may cover lead duties during off-peak.
- **Large format:** Add second lead during high-party weekends; dedicate barback/runner during heavy cafe demand.

## Metrics to Monitor
- Labor as % of revenue by daypart; adjust staffing to hit 30–34% weekly target.
- Member check-in wait time (<3 minutes) and cafe ticket times (<3 minutes for espresso core).
- Safety incidents per 1,000 play hours; goal <1 minor, zero critical.
- Staff retention and cross-training completion rates.
