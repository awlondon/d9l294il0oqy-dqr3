# Operations Manual Highlights

## Kids as Witnesses of Creative Work
- Maintain clear sightlines between play and cowork zones so kids can observe real work without disruption.
- Offer short, optional "quiet tour" passes where kids can walk by desks respectfully.
- Encourage staff to answer curiosity with simple language ("They’re designing an app" / "She’s writing a book").
- Keep the cowork area authentic—no staged demos or performances.

## Membership flow
- Follow the capped membership rules in `docs/tech/membership-and-access.md`: move waitlist invites in order and respect response windows.
- When a member cancels, trigger the waitlist invite immediately and log notifications.

## Guest passes and drop-ins
- Verify guest passes at check-in and decrement usage; assign `guest` tier for the visit.
- Drop-ins pay day-rate pricing and do not receive member perks or locker access.
- Monitor kid:adult ratios; pause new check-ins if safety ratios are at risk.

## Events
- Confirm RSVPs against capacity; hold spots only when confirmed.
- Send after-event thank-yous with gentle membership and guest-pass links.
- Never allow high-pressure sales or hidden upsells during events.

## Contributors
- Provide clear schedules and safety guidelines for approved contributors.
- Track hours and perks earned; rotate tasks to avoid burnout.
- Remind contributors they can stop anytime with no penalty.
