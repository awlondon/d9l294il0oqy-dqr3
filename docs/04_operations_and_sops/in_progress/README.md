# Operations drafts and legacy SOPs

This folder consolidates work-in-progress operations content that previously lived under `docs/operations/`. Use these files for drafts, references, and pending revisions before promoting updates into the canonical `docs/04_operations_and_sops/` root.

## Contents
- `roles_and_staffing_model.md` — draft role ladders and staffing model.
- `enrollment_and_house_rules_script.md` — narrative for onboarding and policy readouts.
- `daily_checklists/` — early checklist drafts.
- `host_SOP.md`, `play_attendant_SOP.md`, `cafe_SOP.md`, `runner_SOP.md` — legacy SOP versions maintained for reference.
- `manual.md` — catch-all operational notes to review and fold into canonical SOPs.
