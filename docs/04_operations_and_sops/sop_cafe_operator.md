# SOP – Café Operator/Barista

## Purpose
Deliver fast, consistent café service that complements cowork and play experiences.

## Scope
Applies to all café staff responsible for beverage/food production, café seating upkeep, and light catering for parties/events.

## Responsibilities
- Execute beverage and food menu to spec with target ticket times under 3 minutes for core drinks.
- Maintain café cleanliness, temperature logs, and inventory rotation.
- Coordinate with Host/Play for large groups, parties, and allergen notes.
- Promote member perks and add-on sales (grab-and-go, kids’ bentos, retail).

## Daily Routine
- **Pre-open:** Dial espresso, prep batch items, set pars for pastries/grab-and-go, sanitize bar, stock condiment station, check temp logs.
- **Active hours:**
  - Take orders with member discounts applied; suggestive sell pairing (kids’ bento + latte, snack boxes for meetings).
  - Produce drinks/food per recipe cards; monitor ticket times.
  - Wipe bar/condiment every 30 minutes; rotate pastries; monitor waste.
- **Wrap:** Deep clean machines, purge/soak parts, label/date remaining product, empty trash/compost, reconcile cash/POS.

## Procedures
1. **Quality Control**
   - Follow recipe cards; calibrate grinders each shift and after rushes.
   - Reject expired or temperature-compromised items; log waste.
2. **Allergen Handling**
   - Confirm allergen notes on tickets; use separate pitchers/utensils; change gloves after allergens.
   - Inform guest if cross-contact risk exists; escalate to Shift Lead for severe allergies.
3. **Speed of Service**
   - During peak, assign roles: order-taker, bar, runner. Hosts may support grab-and-go handoff.
   - Use mobile/member pre-orders; prioritize items with longest brew time first.
4. **Catering/Parties**
   - Prep party platters 30 minutes before start; coordinate with party captain for delivery timing.

## Escalation Path
- Equipment failure: Shift Lead → Manager → Vendor; switch to backup brew methods if needed.
- Food safety concerns: Stop service for affected item, notify Manager, follow discard/clean protocol.
- Guest complaints: Offer remake; if unresolved, Shift Lead to comp/adjust and record in feedback log.

## Metrics of Success
- Ticket time ≤3 minutes for espresso core; ≤6 minutes for food requiring heat.
- Waste under 2% of café sales; accurate temp logs 100% of days.
- Café cleanliness audit >95%; upsell attachment rate >65% of check-ins.
