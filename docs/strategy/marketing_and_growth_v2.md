# Marketing & Growth Strategy (v2)

> Dates and targeting are tuned for an early 2026 Phoenix flagship opening. Messaging centers on being a **work-enabler for caregivers** with membership-first access to supervised play, cowork seating, and café hospitality.

## Pre-Launch (Founding Members & Awareness)

- Founding member campaign timed to design + site announcement; gated waitlist with tier previews (no unlimited tier).
- Partnerships: employers offering caregiver stipends, pediatric/OB practices, doulas, parent groups, and neighborhood associations.
- Content and social: behind-the-scenes design/build progress, host-gated safety messaging, “work-with-kids” narratives.
- PR: local business press + family/parenting outlets; frame as acoustically engineered, host-gated alternative to loud play cafes.

## Grand Opening (Soft → Public)

- Invite-only soft opening to validate flows (seat ordering, host check-in, safety drills).
- Opening weekend with timed blocks, membership incentives, and demo classes/workshops.
- Clear signage and scripting to reduce “daycare vs cowork” confusion; reinforce supervised play scope.

## First 100 Members

- Founding member pricing with session caps; add-on per extra child to manage utilization.
- Employer stipend pilots for hybrid/remote workers with kids under 6.
- Referral and loyalty hooks tied to café spend and session usage.
- Early cohort listening loops (NPS, host feedback) to tune policies before broader marketing.

## Steady-State Retention & Acquisition

- Programming cadence: member-only play blocks, workshops, and hosted events to reinforce community feel.
- Paid media tuned to peak life moments (parental leave return, seasonal breaks) with clear “not a daycare” positioning.
- Churn watchlist: proactive outreach at 30/60/90 days; personalized offers tied to usage patterns.
- Café and event upsell prompts in-app and via host scripts; highlight acoustics and productivity for caregivers.

## Measurement & Tooling

- Track CAC/LTV by channel; segment by member tier and shared caregiver usage.
- Attribute conversions to employer programs vs consumer channels.
- Use CRM + analytics dashboards to monitor membership churn, seat utilization, and café ticket size (see `docs/tech/system_overview.md`).
