# Risk Analysis & Mitigation – Co.work.PLAY Café

This document consolidates major risks for the Co.work.PLAY flagship and franchise system, along with mitigation strategies. It draws on an AI-generated reference plan but is adapted to our actual concept and risk tolerance.

## 1. Liability & Safety

**Risk:** Injury to a child, allegations of misconduct, or perceived unsafe environment.

**Mitigation:**

- Robust insurance coverage.
- Background checks and training (CPR/First Aid) for all play staff.
- Clear, signed waivers and house rules (see `docs/06_legal_and_policy/`).
- Video coverage in play areas (no bathrooms) with privacy safeguards.
- Strict incident reporting and escalation protocols.

## 2. Capacity & Utilization

**Risk:** Overcrowding or underutilization that erodes experience and margins; wrong mix of memberships vs day passes.

**Mitigation:**

- Host-gated entries with session caps per membership tier.
- Live capacity dashboard showing adults, kids, and open workstations.
- Pricing levers to shape mix (session caps, add-on fees, founding member offers).
- Time-buffered scheduling for parties and peak windows.

## 3. Staff Turnover & Training Quality

**Risk:** Inconsistent service, safety lapses, and higher costs from churn.

**Mitigation:**

- Clear role ladders (Host → Lead → Manager) with pay progression.
- Paid training with certification on safety, sanitation, guest scripting, and incident response.
- Use Sora-style video prompts to standardize training delivery.
- Cross-training across host/play/café to smooth scheduling gaps.

## 4. Market Acceptance & Positioning

**Risk:** Confusion between cowork space vs daycare vs cafe; parents misunderstanding supervision boundaries.

**Mitigation:**

- Messaging anchored on “work-enabler for caregivers” and “host-gated supervised play,” not daycare.
- Prominent house rules and eligibility reminders in onboarding and onsite signage.
- Founding-member tours and employer stipend partnerships to reinforce the model.
- Member-only programming that differentiates from open-play competitors.

## 5. Regulatory & Licensing

**Risk:** Misclassification as daycare or failure to meet local occupancy and health codes.

**Mitigation:**

- Early legal review of supervised play vs childcare regulations in Phoenix metro.
- Align design with assembly/mercantile occupancy and food service requirements.
- Maintain clear ratio targets and host supervision policies to support non-daycare positioning.
- Engage local authorities during schematic design for feedback.

## 6. Technology & Automation

**Risk:** AI-GM/automation features underdeliver or disrupt operations; POS or ordering downtime impacts guest experience.

**Mitigation:**

- Start with human-led operations; layer AI-GM as monitoring/notification only in Phase 1.
- Redundant internet and POS failover procedures.
- Seat-based ordering with manual fallback (host or runner support) if devices fail.
- Privacy-first biometrics/PIN login options; opt-in only.
- Pilot robotic runners only after reliability proven; humans remain primary service model.

## 7. Financial & Capital

**Risk:** CapEx overruns on ~8,500 sf build or slower-than-expected ramp impacts liquidity.

**Mitigation:**

- Contingency baked into $≈2.2M project budget; vendor bids validated early.
- Phased hiring to match demand ramp; flex staffing around peak windows.
- Founding member pre-sales and employer programs to improve day-one cash flow.
- Monthly KPI reviews (membership churn, CAC/LTV, café ticket size) to adjust quickly.
