# Membership Terms of Service (Plain-Language Draft)

Mirrors the outline in `docs/06_legal_and_policy/membership_terms_of_service.md`; use this version for new sites and counsel review.

## Membership Types & Payments
- **Monthly memberships:** Auto-renew month-to-month with listed adults/children; pricing published in-app and on-site.
- **Prepaid options:** Multi-month or annual prepay available at posted discounts; renews at then-current rates unless cancelled before renewal date.
- **Add-ons:** Guest passes, extra child hours, and program add-ons billed at published rates.
- **Billing method:** Primary payment method stored on file; backup method encouraged to prevent lapses.

## Check-In & Identification
- Adults and children receive matching wristbands/QRs; only authorized adults on the account may pick up children.
- ID may be requested at check-in or pick-up; photo preferences recorded in the account.
- Access may be paused for nonpayment or safety concerns.

## Shared Caregivers & Nannies

### Approved Caregivers

- Each member household may designate one or more **Approved Caregivers** (for example, a nanny, grandparent, relative, or close friend) who are allowed to bring the member’s child(ren) to Co.work.PLAY Cafe.
- Approved Caregivers must be registered in the member’s account with full name and contact details.
- The member is responsible for ensuring that Approved Caregivers understand and follow all house rules, safety policies, and wellness standards.

### Multiple Families, One Caregiver

- Co.work.PLAY Cafe allows a single Approved Caregiver (such as a nanny) to bring children from multiple member households, provided:
  - Each child is registered under their own parent/guardian’s membership, and
  - Each parent/guardian has actively designated that caregiver as an Approved Caregiver for their child(ren).
- When an Approved Caregiver is on site with children from multiple households, they are considered the **caregiver of record** for that session. Children remain under their supervision and responsibility at all times while on the premises.

### Responsibility & Non-Daycare Status

- Co.work.PLAY Cafe is not a licensed daycare or childcare center. Our staff supervise the **environment** (including the play area) but do not replace the role of the accompanying caregiver.
- At all times, a designated adult (member or Approved Caregiver) must be present on site and is responsible for the behavior, safety, and wellbeing of the children in their care.
- Unless a specifically advertised staffed drop-off program is offered, visits are **on-site supervision only** and require the caregiver of record to stay for the duration of the session.

## Wellness & Safety Expectations
- **24-hour non-sick policy:** Families agree not to visit if any listed adult/child has been symptomatic within the past 24 hours.
- Follow posted house rules (socks in play zones, food in cafe areas, supervision requirements) and staff instructions.
- Staff may redirect guests to the “dirty toy” station or cleaning queue when items are soiled.

## Cancellations, Pauses, and Refunds
- **Cancellation:** Provide notice before the next billing date to avoid future charges; membership remains active through the paid period.
- **Pauses:** Limited-duration pauses allowed for moves/health per published policy; billing resumes automatically at end of pause.
- **Refunds/credits:** No refunds for partial months; credits may be issued for extended closures or service disruptions.
- **Failed payments:** Retried automatically; access may be suspended after the retry window.

## Conduct & Use of Facilities
- Members and guests must behave respectfully toward staff and other families; harassment or unsafe conduct may result in suspension or termination.
- Outside food/drink rules, allergy accommodations, and capacity limits are posted locally; staff decisions on safety are final.

## Liability & Consent
- Members acknowledge inherent risks of indoor play and agree to supervise children per posted ratios; release of liability applies to the fullest extent permitted by law.
- Photo/video consent preferences are captured at sign-up and can be updated anytime.

## Privacy & Data Use
- Personal data is used for account management, safety, and marketing as described in the Privacy Policy and Data Use notice; data is not sold.

## Changes to Terms
- Updates communicated via email/app with effective dates; continued use after effective date constitutes acceptance.

## Local Addenda
- Site-specific requirements (health, data, dispute resolution) will be attached where required by law.
