# Membership Terms of Service (Plain-Language Draft)

Mirrors the outline in `docs/06_legal_and_policy/membership_terms_of_service.md`; use this version for new sites and counsel review.

## Membership Types & Payments
- **Monthly memberships:** Auto-renew month-to-month with listed adults/children; pricing published in-app and on-site.
- **Prepaid options:** Multi-month or annual prepay available at posted discounts; renews at then-current rates unless cancelled before renewal date.
- **Add-ons:** Guest passes, extra child hours, and program add-ons billed at published rates.
- **Billing method:** Primary payment method stored on file; backup method encouraged to prevent lapses.

## Check-In & Identification
- Adults and children receive matching wristbands/QRs; only authorized adults on the account may pick up children.
- ID may be requested at check-in or pick-up; photo preferences recorded in the account.
- Access may be paused for nonpayment or safety concerns.

## Wellness & Safety Expectations
- **24-hour non-sick policy:** Families agree not to visit if any listed adult/child has been symptomatic within the past 24 hours.
- Follow posted house rules (socks in play zones, food in café areas, supervision requirements) and staff instructions.
- Staff may redirect guests to the “dirty toy” station or cleaning queue when items are soiled.

## Cancellations, Pauses, and Refunds
- **Cancellation:** Provide notice before the next billing date to avoid future charges; membership remains active through the paid period.
- **Pauses:** Limited-duration pauses allowed for moves/health per published policy; billing resumes automatically at end of pause.
- **Refunds/credits:** No refunds for partial months; credits may be issued for extended closures or service disruptions.
- **Failed payments:** Retried automatically; access may be suspended after the retry window.

## Conduct & Use of Facilities
- Members and guests must behave respectfully toward staff and other families; harassment or unsafe conduct may result in suspension or termination.
- Outside food/drink rules, allergy accommodations, and capacity limits are posted locally; staff decisions on safety are final.

## Liability & Consent
- Members acknowledge inherent risks of indoor play and agree to supervise children per posted ratios; release of liability applies to the fullest extent permitted by law.
- Photo/video consent preferences are captured at sign-up and can be updated anytime.

## Privacy & Data Use
- Personal data is used for account management, safety, and marketing as described in the Privacy Policy and Data Use notice; data is not sold.

## Changes to Terms
- Updates communicated via email/app with effective dates; continued use after effective date constitutes acceptance.

## Local Addenda
- Site-specific requirements (health, data, dispute resolution) will be attached where required by law.
