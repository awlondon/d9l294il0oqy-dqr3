# Children Safety and Wellness Policy

Operational policy to protect children and set clear expectations for families.

## Wellness Standards
- **24-hour non-sick policy:** Do not visit if a child or adult has fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or other contagious symptoms within the past 24 hours.
- **Onsite screening:** Staff may request a temperature or wellness check if a child appears unwell.
- **Cleaning triggers:** Visibly soiled toys/items go immediately to the “dirty toy” station for sanitizing.

## Supervision & Ratios
- **Adult presence:** An authorized adult remains on-site during each visit unless a staffed drop-off program is explicitly offered.
- **Staff roles:** Hosts manage entry/exit; play attendants monitor floor safety; café team enforces food/bev rules; managers oversee incidents.
- **Capacity limits:** Enforced by zone; staff may meter entry to maintain safe ratios (e.g., under-2 zone at tighter ratios).

## Conduct & Behavior
- Gentle play expected; no climbing on non-play structures or roughhousing in crowded areas.
- Adults responsible for their children’s behavior; staff may redirect or pause play to maintain safety.
- Respect for staff instructions is required; harassment or unsafe conduct may result in removal or membership suspension.

## Escalation Steps
1. Staff coaching and redirection to safer play or alternate zone.
2. Temporary pause of play for the child/party to reset; document in incident log.
3. If behavior continues or safety risk persists, request that the family end the visit for the day.
4. Repeated or severe violations may lead to membership review/suspension by management.

## Incident & Wellness Follow-Up
- Incidents documented with time, zone, staff involved, and any first aid provided.
- Families notified of material incidents before exit; follow-up email/app message sent when appropriate.
- House rules updates posted on-site and in-app when policies change.
