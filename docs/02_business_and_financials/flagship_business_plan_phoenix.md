# Flagship Business Plan – Phoenix Metro (≈8,500 SF)

## Purpose
Provide the narrative business plan for the first Co.work.PLAY Café flagship, aligning leadership, investors, lenders, and landlord partners around market fit, programming, and financial performance.

## Market Context
- **Location thesis:** East Valley/Scottsdale border with strong young family density, high dual-income households, and proximity to healthcare/tech employers with remote policies.
- **Competition:** Independent coffee shops (limited seating, no play), indoor play spaces (no cowork or café), and traditional coworking (no family support). There is no integrated offer serving both productivity and supervised play.
- **Demand signals:** Waiting lists at Montessori/early learning, corporate caregiver benefits stipends, and rising remote/hybrid workforce.

## Concept & Program
- Café with full espresso, quick-serve food, kids’ bentos, and grab-and-go.
- Cowork zones: open seating, 6 phone booths, 3 meeting rooms (8–12p capacity), and 2 focus nooks for pumping/quiet use.
- Play: 2–5 play structure, under-2 sensory room, STEM/arts rotation carts, and a 600 SF party studio.
- Back-of-house: prep/commissary, storage, stroller parking, laundry, janitorial, staff break, and IT closet.

## Pricing & Offering
- **Family membership:** $320/month includes supervised play for up to 2 children (2-hour windows), cowork seating, and café discounts.
- **Day pass:** $35/family for up to 2 hours of play and cowork access; additional hour $12.
- **Meeting rooms:** $65/hour (members), $80/hour (non-members).
- **Parties:** $750 base package for 2 hours, 12 kids, includes party captain and light catering options.
- **Programming:** $45/enrollment classes (music/movement/arts), seasonal camps at premium pricing.

- **Total monthly revenue:** ≈ **$247,000** (annualized ≈ $3.0M).

## Cost Structure (Monthly at Scale)

- Training: All roles certified on safety, sanitation, guest scripting, and incident response before solo shifts.

## Go-to-Market
- **Pre-sale:** 8-week campaign with founding-member pricing, employer stipend outreach, and influencer/parent group tours.
- **Soft opening:** Invite-only with timed blocks to test throughput and safety drills.
- **Partnerships:** Pediatric practices, doulas, HR benefit platforms, and neighborhood associations.
- **Retention:** Member-only programming, early booking windows, and personalized check-ins at 30/60/90 days.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Safety incidents:** Redundant headcounts, CCTV coverage of entries, and documented drills every two weeks.
