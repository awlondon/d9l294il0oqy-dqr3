# Residential Micro-Franchise Model

The micro-franchise model describes how Co.work.PLAY Café is replicated as **small, owner-operated neighborhood units** with a consistent sensory and operational blueprint.

## 1. Unit Archetype

- Footprint: ~1,200–1,800 sq ft
- Zones:
  - Cowork seats: ~10–16
  - Supervised play slots (toddlers + under-2 area): ~10–14
  - Small café counter with high-margin beverages and kid-friendly snacks
- Design:
  - Soft sound envelope and acoustic treatment
  - Warm, safe lighting with time-of-day presets
  - Clear sightlines from staff to children

## 2. Owner-Operator Profile

- Local family (ideally parents themselves) embedded in the neighborhood.
- Comfortable with:
  - Hosting and customer interaction
  - Managing part-time staff
  - Following structured SOPs and safety protocols
- The local owner is the **face of trust**; the brand is the system backing them.

## 3. Daypart & Revenue Structure

- **Dayparts:**
  - AM Focus Blocks (2–3 hr): parents do deep work.
  - Midday Café + Light Play.
  - PM Play Blocks & micro-events (storytime, sensory play, etc.).

- **Pricing Anchors (illustrative):**
  - Cowork 2.5 hr block
  - Supervised play 2.5 hr block
  - Bundled “Parent Sprint” (seat + play)
  - Membership tiers with:
    - Priority booking
    - Member pricing on blocks
    - Occasional member-only events

The model is **utilization-driven**: ensure each daypart has enough filled blocks across cowork and play.

## 4. Standardized Sensory & Ops Kit

Each micro-franchise receives a **standard kit**:

- Sound: speakers + acoustic recommendations + dBA targets.
- Scent: pre-selected “clean, warm, safe” profile at controlled intensity.
- Lighting: circadian-aware presets mapped to the floor plan.
- Wayfinding: color-coded zones and signage (host, play, café, restrooms, exits).
- Tablets & UI: standardized interface for host, play attendant, café, and manager.

The kit allows each location to feel uniquely local but **instantly recognizable** as Co.work.PLAY Café.

## 5. Role of AI-GM in Micro-Franchise Units

- Ensures:
  - Booking does not exceed safe child:attendant ratios.
  - Staff follow check-in and check-out protocols.
  - Incidents are logged and surfaced to owners.
  - F&B ordering and notifications are unified in one interface.

AI-GM is the **operational co-pilot** that keeps standards consistent across dozens of owner-operated units.

## 6. Franchise Economics (High-Level)

- Revenue:
  - Time-boxed services (cowork, play).
  - Memberships.
  - Café margin.

- Franchise fees:
  - Initial franchise fee.
  - Ongoing royalty (percentage of gross).
  - Optional tech + sensory kit subscription.

The micro-franchise model is tuned for small units that can be run by a local family, with AI-GM and the sensory kit doing a lot of the “heavy lifting” on consistency and quality.
