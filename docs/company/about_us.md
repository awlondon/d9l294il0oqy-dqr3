# About Co.work.PLAY Café

Co.work.PLAY Café was founded by Alexander Warren London and Savannah Strasner, with initial capital support from Michael Strasner. The idea emerged from a simple need: a place where working caregivers could get real work done while their young children play nearby in a safe, supervised environment.

From the beginning, Co.work.PLAY Café has been designed as a system, not a personality brand. The flagship locations in the Phoenix area are prototypes: proving grounds for layout, safety standards, membership models, and technology. Once proven, these elements are documented, simplified, and handed to franchise owners so they can take true ownership in their communities.

Our focus now is on investors and local owners who want to build durable businesses around this model. The corporate team maintains the playbook—brand standards, safety protocols, training, and technology—and franchisees bring it to life on the ground. Each store should feel like “my café” to the owner and their team, within a shared framework that protects kids, staff, and the brand as a whole.
