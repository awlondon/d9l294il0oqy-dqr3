# Concept Overview

Co.work.play Café combines a specialty café and flexible coworking environment with supervised play for toddlers. The concept targets remote-working parents—primarily moms with toddlers—with an approachable, safe, and hospitality-driven space. Flexible access options (memberships and day passes) allow parents to work productively while children enjoy age-appropriate play guided by attendants.

The brand vision centers on being the trusted “third place” for families who balance work and caregiving. The flagship serves as the prototype for design, operations, and training before rolling out via franchising.
