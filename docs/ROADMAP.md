## Long-Term Expansion

### Phase 3–4: Airport / Transit Hub Exploration (Co.work.PLAY Express)

- Develop an **Express** variant of Co.work.PLAY for international airports and major transit hubs.
- Focus: short, high-value visits (30–90 minutes) for traveling families.
- Status: **Future exploration only.** No current commitments for airport units until:
  - Core flagship + neighborhood models are proven across multiple metros.
  - Systems and economics are stable at scale.
- See: [Airport / Transit Hub Concept – Future Exploration](./expansion/airport_transit_hub_concept.md)
