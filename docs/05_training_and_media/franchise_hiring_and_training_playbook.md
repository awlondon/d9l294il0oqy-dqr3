# Franchise Hiring and Training Playbook

## Purpose
Provide a timeline and content checklist for staffing, training, and launch readiness for franchise locations.

## Timeline (T = Target Opening)
- **T-24 to T-12 weeks:** Finalize org chart, post manager/lead roles, start background checks pipeline.
- **T-12 to T-8 weeks:** Hire Manager and Shift Leads; enroll in LMS; schedule on-site training dates.
- **T-8 to T-4 weeks:** Hire hosts, play attendants, and cafe team; complete online modules (safety, service, brand).
- **T-4 to T-2 weeks:** Run mock shifts with friends/family; practice check-in, cafe menu, and safety drills.
- **T-2 to T-1 week:** Soft-opening rehearsals, POS/tech validation, health inspection walkthrough.
- **T week:** Soft open with invited members/day-pass guests; daily retros; adjust staffing pars.
- **T+1 week:** Grand opening; move to standard schedule; schedule 30/60/90-day performance check-ins.

## Training Structure
- **Role-based modules:** Host, Play Attendant, Cafe Operator, Shift Lead/Manager (see `training_modules_index.md`).
- **Modalities:** LMS videos (including Sora prompts), live workshops, shadow shifts, and printed SOP cards.
- **Certification:** Each role must pass a quiz and practical sign-off; leads certify checklists and incident response drills.

## Soft-Opening Strategy
- Invite founding members, community partners, and friends/family in timed blocks to stress test.
- Run at 50–70% capacity; focus on check-in accuracy, cafe ticket times, and safety headcounts.
- Capture feedback daily; adjust staffing templates and scripts before grand opening.

## Staffing Bench & Cross-Training
- Maintain 10–15% bench (on-call/part-time) for coverage; cross-train hosts in cafe POS and cafe team in basic play resets.
- Require all team members to complete CPR/First Aid and child-safety modules before unsupervised shifts.

## Manager Toolkit
- Hiring scorecards per role; structured interviews focused on hospitality, safety, and childcare awareness.
- Onboarding checklist (I-9, payroll, handbook acknowledgement, tech credentials, policy training).
- Performance metrics: labor %, ticket times, membership conversion, NPS, incident compliance.

## Franchisee Responsibilities
- Budget for paid training hours in pre-open; schedule time for cleaning drills and role-play.
- Maintain training records for compliance; share completion data with franchisor before soft opening.
- Use franchisor-provided Sora video set for consistency; request updates as menu or policies change.
