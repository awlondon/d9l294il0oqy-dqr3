## Prompts
- **HOST-01 – Greeting & Check-In**  
  “A friendly café host stands at a modern wood and pastel reception desk. Soft natural light, families entering with toddlers. The host smiles, scans a phone, applies matching wristbands to parent and child, and gestures toward a calm play area. Style: clean, bright, warm-modern.”

- **HOST-02 – Wristbands & Safety Verifications**  
  “Close-up of hands applying color-coded wristbands to adult and child. The host points to safety signage, checks a digital tablet for allergies, and nods. Background shows a tidy lobby with stroller parking.”

- **HOST-03 – Conversion & Upsell**  
  “Host at reception explains membership benefits to a parent holding coffee. On-screen graphics show ‘Save with membership’ and ‘Party discounts.’ Host points to a wall calendar of classes.”

- **PLAY-01 – Safety & Ratios**  
  “Play attendant in branded apron counts children on a soft play structure, holding a clicker. Attendant checks gate latch, glances at a digital headcount log, and gives thumbs up. Warm, organized play space.”

- **PLAY-02 – Engagement Blocks**  
  “Play attendant leads a short storytime with toddlers on soft mats, then rotates toys into labeled bins. Scene shifts to wiping down blocks with sanitizer and smiling at parents through glass.”

- **PLAY-03 – Incident Response**  
  “Calm play attendant kneels to assist a child with a minor scrape, applies a bandage, and radios the shift lead. Parent is reassured; signage for incident log visible on a tablet.”

- **CAFE-01 – Espresso & Beverage Quality**  
  “Barista calibrates grinder, pulls espresso shot with scale and timer, textures milk to glossy microfoam, and pours a heart latte art. Café is bright, minimal, with kid-friendly banquette nearby.”

- **CAFE-02 – Food Safety & Allergen Handling**  
  “Barista puts on gloves, reads allergen note on a ticket, uses separate pitcher and utensils marked ‘allergen safe,’ and wipes station afterward. Thermometer checks milk temperature.”

- **CAFE-03 – Speed of Service**  
  “Three café teammates in a small bar: one taking orders on tablet, one on espresso, one handing out drinks. Timer overlay shows sub-3-minute tickets. Kids and parents wait comfortably.”

- **LEAD-01 – Shift Leadership & Huddles**  
  “Shift lead gathers team of host, play attendant, and barista for a quick huddle near the host stand. They point at a whiteboard with today’s parties, KPIs, and safety focus.”

- **LEAD-02 – Service Recovery & Comps**  
  “Manager speaks calmly with a parent guest at café table, listens, apologizes, and hands a comp card. Body language is empathetic; child plays nearby.”

- **LEAD-03 – Incident Investigation**  
  “Manager reviews CCTV at a small office desk, completes an incident report on laptop, then walks the play area to check equipment with a maintenance checklist.”
