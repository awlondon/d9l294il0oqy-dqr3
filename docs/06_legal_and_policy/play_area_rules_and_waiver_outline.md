# Play Area Rules and Waiver Outline

## Purpose
Provide concise rules for display near play zones and key waiver clauses for legal review.

## Display Rules (Guest-Facing)
- Socks required for children and adults inside play areas; no shoes on mats/structures.
- No outside food or drink beyond designated café-safe zones; water bottles allowed.
- Caregivers must remain on-site and reachable; under-2 area is calm/quiet only.
- Report spills or hazards immediately to staff; follow staff directions at all times.
- Children who are ill or recently feverish should not enter; staff may refuse entry.
- Rough play, throwing toys, or climbing on exterior of structures is not allowed.
- Respect others’ belongings; stroller parking and cubbies available.

## Waiver Clauses (For Legal Drafting)
- Acknowledgment of inherent risks of indoor play and assumption of risk by guardians.
- Agreement to follow staff instructions and posted rules; failure may result in removal.
- Consent to basic first-aid; emergency medical consent if guardian cannot be reached (permitted by law).
- Release and hold harmless Co.work.play entities, owners, employees, and franchisees to the extent allowed by law.
- Photo/video consent options with clear opt-out instructions; no public use without consent.
- Statement that Co.work.play is not a licensed childcare provider; supervised play is not a daycare substitute.
- Indemnity for damages caused by guest negligence or misuse of equipment.

## Operational Notes
- Display rules at host stand and at play entry; ensure readability and translations as needed.
- Collect waiver during first visit; renew annually or when terms change materially.
- Maintain digital records tied to wristband/tag numbers and authorized pickups.
