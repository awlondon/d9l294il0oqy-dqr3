# Children Safety and Wellness Policy

Operational policy to protect children and set clear expectations for families.

## Wellness Standards
- **24-hour non-sick policy:** Do not visit if a child or adult has fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or other contagious symptoms within the past 24 hours.
- **Onsite screening:** Staff may request a temperature or wellness check if a child appears unwell.
- **Cleaning triggers:** Visibly soiled toys/items go immediately to the “dirty toy” station for sanitizing.

## Supervision & Ratios
- **Adult presence:** An authorized adult remains on-site during each visit unless a staffed drop-off program is explicitly offered.
- **Staff roles:** Hosts manage entry/exit; play attendants monitor floor safety; cafe team enforces food/bev rules; managers oversee incidents.
- **Capacity limits:** Enforced by zone; staff may meter entry to maintain safe ratios (e.g., under-2 zone at tighter ratios).

### Shared Caregivers & Group Visits

- For safety reasons, Co.work.PLAY Cafe may limit the number of children one caregiver can supervise at a time, based on age and activity level.
- As a general guideline:
  - One adult may supervise up to 3 children over age 3.
  - For children under age 3, stricter ratios or additional adults may be required.
- Our staff may refuse entry, request additional adults, or modify access if we believe a caregiver is responsible for more children than they can safely supervise in this environment.
- Staff are instructed to treat the on-site caregiver (member or Approved Caregiver) as the primary point of contact for all behavior, safety, and wellness issues relating to the children in their group.
- Note: Co.work.PLAY Cafe is a supervised play environment, not a licensed daycare facility. Our team supports safety and play, but does not assume full-time caregiver duties for any child.

## Conduct & Behavior
- Gentle play expected; no climbing on non-play structures or roughhousing in crowded areas.
- Adults responsible for their children’s behavior; staff may redirect or pause play to maintain safety.
- Respect for staff instructions is required; harassment or unsafe conduct may result in removal or membership suspension.

## Escalation Steps
1. Staff coaching and redirection to safer play or alternate zone.
2. Temporary pause of play for the child/party to reset; document in incident log.
3. If behavior continues or safety risk persists, request that the family end the visit for the day.
4. Repeated or severe violations may lead to membership review/suspension by management.

## Incident & Wellness Follow-Up
- Incidents documented with time, zone, staff involved, and any first aid provided.
- Families notified of material incidents before exit; follow-up email/app message sent when appropriate.
- House rules updates posted on-site and in-app when policies change.
