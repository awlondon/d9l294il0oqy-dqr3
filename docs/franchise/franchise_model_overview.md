# Franchise Model Overview (Draft)

> NOTE: All values in this doc are provisional and subject to change once we finalize flagship performance and 100-store rollout economics. Claude’s reference plan suggested ranges for fees and royalties; we will not lock anything until we have real flagship data.

## Fee Structure (Draft Ranges)

- Initial franchise fee: [TODO – draft range]
- Ongoing royalty: [TODO – % of gross sales]
- Marketing fund contribution: [TODO – % of gross sales]
- Tech/platform fee: [TODO – monthly or %], aligned with AI-GM and ordering stack.

## Ideal Franchisee Profile

- Experienced multi-unit operator in hospitality/retail.
- Alignment with “work-enabler for caregivers” positioning and host-gated safety culture.
- Comfortable investing in acoustically engineered build and membership-first operations.
- Capital ready for ~$2.2M flagship-quality build (adapted by market) with contingency.

## Territory & Footprint Guidance

- Primary model: ~8,500 sq ft neighborhood/community retail centers with strong family density.
- Secondary variants: smaller neighborhood units or future Express concepts only after flagship validation.
- Territory protection to be defined per market size and demographics. [TODO]

## Training & Support (Draft)

- Pre-opening training (hosts, play attendants, café, managers) using Sora-driven content and onsite labs.
- Launch support team for opening month; remote support thereafter.
- Access to design standards, vendor lists, and SOPs via franchise portal (see `docs/tech/system_overview.md`).

## Economics & Reporting

- Franchisee P&L reporting cadence: monthly dashboards covering revenue mix, membership churn, café ticket, and staffing ratios.
- Benchmarks will be published once flagship data matures; current targets mirror Phoenix ranges (20–30% store-level EBITDA, realistic rent/wage assumptions).
- Capital payback and multi-unit incentives remain TBD pending validated unit performance.

## Road to Offering

- Validate flagship performance (12–18 months of data).
- Finalize 100-store P&L and market-by-market CapEx templates.
- Update FDD drafts with confirmed fee/royalty structure and territory rules.
- Launch controlled pilot franchises before broader release.
