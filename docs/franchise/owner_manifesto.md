# Co.work.PLAY Café – Owner Manifesto

## What this is (and what it isn’t)
Co.work.PLAY is a system designed to be owned, not a personality-driven or ego-driven venture. The playbook is built so you can run it with discipline and care, independent of any single founder’s charisma.

## You are the face of Co.work.PLAY in your city
As a franchise owner, you are the face of the brand in your community. You own execution in your market and make the concept real for families who trust you with their time and their kids.

## Guardrails and freedom
- Guardrails: protect children and caregivers, uphold safety protocols, keep the brand clean and consistent, and honor the membership promise.
- Freedom: how you build community locally, the partnerships you form, the way you express hospitality, and the tweaks you make to operations to serve your market better.

## People should be here because they want to be
Everyone—from frontline staff to leadership—should be here by choice. If someone feels stuck, that is a problem to surface and solve quickly so the team stays energized and mission-aligned.

## Your commitments as an owner
- Own outcomes: take full responsibility for performance and continuous improvement.
- Protect kids: treat safety, wellness, and security as non-negotiable.
- Maintain the brand: keep standards high, consistent, and on-message.
- Build a real team: hire, coach, and retain people who believe in the mission.
- Use and improve the playbook: run the system as designed and contribute your learnings.

## What you can expect from corporate
- A clear operating system, tools, and training to run the concept with confidence.
- Updates to the playbook as we learn, including timely communications and support.
- Ongoing investment in the brand, technology, and materials that help you win locally.
- Listening to owners and incorporating feedback to strengthen the system.

## The promise to families
A place where caregivers can get real work done while their kids play nearby, safely and joyfully.
