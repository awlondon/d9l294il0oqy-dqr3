# Territory and Site Selection Guide

How to size territories and pick winning locations using the co.work.play criteria.

## Territory Structure
- **Units per metro:** Plan 2–5 units in priority metros based on population density and commute patterns.
- **Protected area:** Exclusive territory defined by a radius or zip/postal code cluster; no corporate units inside the boundary without franchisee consent.
- **Expansion rights:** First right of refusal on adjacent territories when performance targets are met (AUV, member count, QA scores).
- **Performance gates:** Maintain required KPIs to retain exclusivity and development schedule.

## Site Selection Criteria
- **Rent guardrails:** Stay within the rent ranges in the Location Economics Playbook; validate CAM/NNN.
- **Demographics:** Household density, HH income, family concentration, and remote-worker mix that support membership ramp.
- **Access & parking:** Ground-floor or easy elevator access, stroller-friendly entries, plentiful parking, safe evening lighting.
- **Co-tenancy:** Grocery-anchored or daily-needs centers; near schools, fitness, pediatric offices, or family dining.
- **Space form factor:** 10k–14k SF with clear spans for play zones and cafe visibility; ceiling height sufficient for play structures.

## Selection Process
1. Shortlist 5–10 sites using broker pipeline; log each against the criteria above.
2. Run back-of-the-envelope P&L with rent, TI, and membership ramp assumptions.
3. Conduct daytime/nighttime footfall checks; validate traffic with mobile data where available.
4. Compare to competitive map (indoor play, childcare-adjacent, cowork, cafes) and set share targets.
5. Escalate top 2–3 sites for HQ review, site walks, and LOI negotiation.
