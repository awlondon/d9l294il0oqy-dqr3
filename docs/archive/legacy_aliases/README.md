# Legacy alias stash

Older alias directories were consolidated here after moving their active content into the numbered `docs/0X_*` structure. Use these files for historical reference only; all new work should stay in the canonical folders referenced from `docs/README.md`.

## Contents
- `design_README.md` — former index for the `docs/design/` alias.
- `business_and_financials/` — archived P&L and location-economics drafts.
