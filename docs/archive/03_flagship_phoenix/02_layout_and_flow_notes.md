# Phoenix Flagship – Layout & Flow Notes

## 1. Overall Zoning Concept

The flagship layout is organized into **three vertical bands** across a 100' (width) x 85' (depth) rectangle:

1. **Left (Adult Zone)** – Cafe Seating & Lounge, Open Cowork, Quiet Cowork/Phone.  
2. **Center (Family Core)** – Entry/Host/Retail, Main Toddler Play, Baby/Under-2 & Sensory.  
3. **Right (Service Spine)** – Cafe Bar & To-Go, Multi-Use/Party Room, Restrooms + BOH/Kitchen.

The goal is to keep adults and children **connected but not in each other’s way**.

Refer to:

- `design/floorplans/CoWorkPlay_Flagship_FloorPlan_DenseSeating_v1.pdf` (high-capacity layout)

## 2. Entry / Host / Retail Flow

- **Main entry** at center front, opening into the Entry/Host zone.
- **Host desk** offset toward the right, creating a clear *line-of-sight* path to:
  - Main toddler play zone (straight ahead).
  - Cafe seating (left).
  - Cafe bar and multi-use room (right).

Key elements:

- Retail shelves along one side for curated toys/books and branded merchandise.
- Dedicated stroller parking area at the back of the entry zone.
- Check-in process:
  - Membership/guest verification.
  - Wristbands or labels for children.
  - Orientation for first-time guests.

## 3. Adult Zone – Cafe & Cowork

**Cafe Seating & Lounge (front-left)**

- Clusters of small tables for families or solo laptop users.  
- A wall banquette and a small lounge cluster (two sofas + coffee table).  
- Sightline to main play through interior glazing or open portal.

**Open Cowork (mid-left)**

- Long shared tables with power access.  
- A rear counter for printer/lockers/storage.  
- Designed for a moderate hum of activity (laptops, quiet conversations).

**Quiet Cowork & Phone Rooms (back-left)**

- Smaller fixed desks for deeper-focus work.  
- 2–4 enclosed phone rooms/micro-offices.  
- Sound and visual separation from play zones.

## 4. Family Core – Play Zones

**Main Toddler Play (mid-center)**

- Central climber / play structure.  
- Four play “pods” in the corners (e.g., reading nook, pretend kitchen, building blocks).  
- Perimeter benches along cafe-facing edge for supervising adults.  
- Low fence or gate toward entry to control access.

**Baby / Under-2 & Sensory (back-center)**

- Soft mat field for crawlers and new walkers.  
- Sensory pods and low-level equipment.  
- Rocking chairs for caregivers.  
- Separated from the main play area to manage age-appropriate interactions.

## 5. Service Spine – Bar, Party, BOH

**Cafe Bar & To-Go (front-right)**

- Primary espresso and beverage bar.  
- Back bar with refrigeration, storage, and small prep.  
- Multiple POS stations to handle lines efficiently.

**Multi-Use / Party Room (mid-right)**

- Flexible table layout for:
  - Birthday parties.
  - Classes and workshops.
  - Overflow seating during peak times.

- Direct access from main circulation to avoid walking through core play zones during events.

**Restrooms + BOH / Kitchen (back-right)**

- Restroom block (including family-friendly layout).  
- Kitchen/prep area sized for the food program.  
- Storage for supplies, party materials, and staff areas.

## 6. Circulation & Lines of Sight

- Central **spine from entry**:
  - Visual access to play immediately when you walk in.
  - Clear signage and intuitive branching into cafe, cowork, and party room.

- Parents can:
  - Sit in the cafe or cowork and still see the play area.
  - Move quickly between laptop and child if needed.

These notes should be used by design professionals alongside the floorplan PDFs to create detailed architectural and interior design drawings.
