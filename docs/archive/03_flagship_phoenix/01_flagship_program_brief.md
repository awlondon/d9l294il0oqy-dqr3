- Target size: **approximately 8,500 usable square feet**.  
- Configuration: roughly **100' x 85'** interior footprint, single level.

The flagship functions as:

## 2. Target Guest Capacity

- **Children (play zones)**: ~40–50 at peak (mix of toddlers and preschoolers).  
- **Adults (café + cowork)**: ~50–70 seated across café, open cowork, and quiet zones.  
- **Party room**: ~24–40 seats depending on configuration (standard vs dense layout).

Exact counts will be refined with final design and code-compliant layouts.

## 4. Design Priorities

- **Clear zoning** between:
  - Quiet cowork vs. louder café vs. active play.
- **Visual connection**:
  - Parents can see play zones from café/cowork seating.
- **Circulation**:
  - Simple, intuitive path from entry → host → play / café / cowork.
- **Acoustics**:
  - Use materials and partitioning to keep play noise out of quiet zones.
- **Safety**:
  - Controlled access to play areas;
  - Surfaces and fixtures appropriate for children.

---

## 5. Operational Assumptions

- **Hours**: 7–8 AM to early evening (e.g., 7 AM–7 PM), 7 days/week.  
- **Staff roles present most of the day**:
  - Host/front desk.  
  - One or more Play Attendants.  
  - Barista / café operator(s).  
  - Manager (and/or lead).  

These assumptions drive the staffing model and financial projections and will be validated during pilot operations.
