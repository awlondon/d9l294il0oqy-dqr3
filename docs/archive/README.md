# Archived drafts

The directories in this folder capture older numbering schemes and drafts. Use the canonical layout documented in the root `README.md` for all new work:

- `../01_concept_and_brand/`
- `../02_business_and_financials/`
- `../03_architecture_and_design/`
- `../04_operations_and_sops/`
- `../05_training_and_media/`
- `../06_legal_and_policy/`
- `../07_investor_materials/`

Each archived directory includes a stub README pointing to its replacement.
