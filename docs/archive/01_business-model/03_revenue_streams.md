  - Access to cowork + café seating with priority reservations.

- **Expanded Family Membership**  
  - Parent(s) + multiple children.  
  - Discounted incremental child add-ons.

- **Weekday / Off-Peak Memberships**  
  - Lower cost for Monday–Friday, daytime-only access.

  - Allows grandparents, nannies, or extended caregivers to bring the enrolled child under the same membership.
