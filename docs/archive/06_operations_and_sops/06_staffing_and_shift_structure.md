## 3. Baseline Staffing by Daypart (Flagship Example)

> Actual hour-by-hour staffing will be stored in a scheduling tool;  
> this is a conceptual baseline for modeling and training.

---

## 4. Cross-Training Expectations

To maintain flexibility and control labor costs:

- **Host**:
  - Cross-trained in basic café POS for backup.
  - Familiar with Play Attendant safety basics (though not the primary supervisor).

- **Play Attendant**:
  - Cross-trained in basic host functions (check-in and orientation).
  - Able to support simple café tasks during slow times (e.g., bussing).

- **Café Operator**:
  - Cross-trained to assist Host with check-ins during rushes.
  - Able to assist with floor resets and light play-area tidying.

- **Manager**:
  - Fully cross-trained in all stations and able to step in.

Cross-training reduces friction when one station gets overloaded.

## 5. Staffing Levels by Store Size (Franchise Template)

This table can be adapted for different formats:

| Store Format              | Approx. SF | Core Roles per Busy Shift                        |
|---------------------------|-----------:|--------------------------------------------------|
| Urban Compact             | 4–5k       | 1 Manager, 1 Host, 1 Play, 1 Café, 0–1 Support   |
| Neighborhood Co.work.play | 5–6k       | 1 Manager, 1 Host, 1–2 Play, 1–2 Café, 0–1 Support |
| Destination Flagship      | 8–9k       | 1 Manager, 1 Host, 2 Play, 2 Café, 1–2 Support   |

Franchisees can adjust within guidelines based on:

- Membership and visit volume.  
- Seasonality (school year vs summer).  
- Event / party bookings.

---

## 6. Labor & Financial Model Alignment

The financial model assumes:

- Core roles staffed during all **open hours** (with minor adjustments in slow windows).  
- Extra staff on **weekends and peak times**, especially Play and Café.

Managers and franchisees should:

- Track labor as % of revenue and compare to targets.  
- Adjust schedules dynamically:
  - Add staff where guest experience or safety might be impacted.  
  - Reduce where consistent low demand is observed (off-peak weekday afternoons).

---

## 7. Scheduling Practices

- Use a scheduling tool or shared calendar for shifts.  
- Publish schedules at least **2 weeks in advance** where possible.  
- Include:
  - Role, start/end time, and on-call backup if used.
- Encourage staff input on availability but maintain **guest-first coverage** as primary constraint.

This document should be adapted and localized by each franchisee, with franchisor guidance and targets.

### 8.3 Example Formulas (Assume first data row is 2)

- **H2 – HoursPerShift (when StartTime/EndTime are time values)**  
  `= (D2 - C2) * 24`  
  Format column H as Number with 2 decimals. If you prefer, you can hardcode values (e.g., 3.5 or 4) instead of the formula.

- **I2 – DailyLaborCost**  
  `= F2 * G2 * H2`

- Copy H2 and I2 down for all rows to calculate each line’s cost.

### 8.4 Summaries for the Financial Model

- **Average weekday labor cost:** `=SUMIFS($I:$I,$A:$A,"Weekday")`
- **Average weekend labor cost:** `=SUMIFS($I:$I,$A:$A,"Weekend")`
- **Monthly labor cost:** `(Weekdays in month × avg weekday) + (Weekend days × avg weekend)`

Adjust hourly rates (column G) to the Phoenix market or your local assumptions.
