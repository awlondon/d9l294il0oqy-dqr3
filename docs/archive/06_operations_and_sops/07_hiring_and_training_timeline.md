## Hiring Plan by Phase

### Phase 1 – Manager & Foundations (T-6 to T-5)
- **Hire:** 1 General Manager / Store Manager (anchor hire).
- **Manager priorities:**
  - Finalize role descriptions (Host, Play Attendant, Cafe Operator, Support/Flex), pay bands, and shift patterns.
  - Stand up hiring funnels (Indeed/LinkedIn/local channels) and HR workflows (interview steps, reference checks).
  - Review/co-create SOPs (Host, Play, Cafe, Manager) plus cleaning and safety checklists.
  - Lock training module list and sign-off criteria.
- **Why now:** Manager owns culture early and adapts HQ materials to on-the-ground reality.

### Phase 2 – Build Candidate Pipeline (T-4 to T-3)
- **Pipeline roles:** Hosts (2–3), Play Attendants (3–4), Cafe Operators/Baristas (3–4), Support/Flex (1–2, potentially part-time).
- **Actions:**
  - Post job ads; attend local hiring events.
  - Network with nearby colleges (education, early childhood, hospitality) and parenting/childcare communities.
  - Run initial phone/video screens and in-person interviews (Manager + founder for key roles).
- **Outputs:** Shortlist of A/B candidates per role; “preferred hires” ready to offer around T-2.

### Phase 3 – Hire Core Launch Team & Start Training (T-2)
- **Goal:** 80–90% of launch staffing on payroll ~8 weeks before opening.
- **Offers:** 2–3 Hosts, 3–4 Play Attendants, 3–4 Cafe Operators, 1–2 Support/Flex; stagger start dates if needed.
- **Onboarding (first 1–2 weeks):** paperwork, payroll/direct deposit, uniforms, “Welcome to Co.work.PLAY” orientation (brand story, who we serve, hybrid-third-place positioning).
- **Training kickoff:**
  - Self-paced review of SOPs and initial 8–20s Sora clips by role.
  - Manager-led Q&A huddles to anchor learning.

### Phase 4 – Deep Training + Soft Opening (T-1)
- **Environment:** Space mostly built out (furniture, play structures, cafe equipment).
- **Role-specific live practice:**
  - **Host:** Membership/day-pass flows, scripted scenarios (new member, late member, unsure guest), orientation.
  - **Play Attendant:** Daily safety checks on real equipment; roleplay de-escalation, parent call-ins, incident handling.
  - **Cafe Operator:** Espresso dial-in, menu recipes, rush rhythms, party/event food flow.
  - **Manager/Shift Lead:** Daily opening huddles, schedule review/coverage, guest escalation simulations.
- **Soft opening weeks (T-2 to T-1):** Friends-and-family events with full Host/Play/Cafe run-throughs; intentionally stress test volume and special requests.
- **After-action:** 30–45 minute debriefs to capture what broke, guest confusion, staff friction; update SOPs, checklists, and notes for future training clips.

### Phase 5 – Opening & Stabilization (T0 to T+1)
- **Opening week:** Manager + founders on-site and visible; add extra staffing (especially Play and Host) beyond long-run model.
- **Daily rhythms:** Morning huddle (priorities), end-of-day recap (small process tweaks).
- **First 30 days:**
  - Tight feedback loop via messaging (Slack/WhatsApp).
  - Weekly short 1:1s between Manager and each Host, Play Attendant, and senior Cafe staff.
  - At ~30 days: review unclear tasks → update SOPs; identify missing training clips → add to Sora production queue; consider trimming/reallocating labor without harming experience.

## Training Plan by Role (What & When)

### Manager / Shift Lead
- **When:** T-6 to T-1 (ongoing) + coaching after opening.
- **T-6 to T-5:** Brand/concept deep dive; business model and financial drivers; read/refine all SOPs.
- **T-4 to T-2:** Scheduling, labor targets, reporting templates; practice daily huddles and feedback conversations.
- **T-1:** Run full soft-open shifts as acting GM; handle guest issues with founder backup but minimal intervention.

### Host
- **When:** Start at T-2; intensify at T-1.
- **Focus:** Greeting style; concept explanation in 30–45 seconds; member vs day-pass check-in; membership system lookups; wristband codes; POS for passes; capacity management; lost/distressed child protocol; incident escalation to Manager.
- **Practice:** Scripted roleplays plus live reps during soft opens.

### Play Attendant
- **When:** Start at T-2; intensify at T-1.
- **Focus:** Safety checks on play structure and baby area; age-appropriate play and gentle guidance; allergy/health awareness; incident response (minor vs escalate to Manager).
- **Practice:** Real equipment checks in nearly finished space; soft opens with kids present (friends and family first).

### Cafe Operator
- **When:** Start at T-2; intensify at T-1.
- **Focus:** Menu training (recipes, portions, allergen info); espresso bar and beverage prep; basic food handling and hygiene; coordination with Host and Play during rushes.
- **Practice:** Low-stakes test shifts making drinks/food for staff/family; soft opens with real orders and POS.

### Support/Flex
- **When:** T-2 onward.
- **Focus:** Light training in Host, Play, and cafe basics; cleaning and reset procedures; acting as “ears and eyes” where needed.
- **Practice:** Shadow each role during training; switch roles mid-shift during soft opens to build range.

## Scaling to Franchises
- Convert this playbook into a standard “Recommended Opening Timeline” template:
  - **T-6:** Hire Manager.
  - **T-3:** Start staff recruitment.
  - **T-2:** Hire core team and start online modules.
  - **T-1:** In-store training and soft open.
- Attach required materials:
  - Watch list (video training clips).
  - Read list (SOPs, checklists).
  - Sign-off checklist (Manager certifies each staff member before full shifts).
