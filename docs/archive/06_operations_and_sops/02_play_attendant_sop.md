# Play Attendant SOP  
Co.work.PLAY Café

## 1. Role Purpose

The Play Attendant is responsible for:

- Maintaining a **safe, engaging, and inclusive** play environment.
- Actively supervising children in designated play areas.
- Communicating clearly with parents / caregivers and the Host/Manager.
- Documenting and responding to incidents appropriately.

They are not a daycare worker in the legal sense, but act as an **extra set of eyes and hands** so parents can focus while staying on-site.

## 2. Zones Covered

- **Main Toddler Play Area (2–6 years)**  
  - Climber and structure.  
  - Play pods (blocks, pretend play, reading nook, etc.).

- **Baby / Under-2 & Sensory Room**  
  - Mat field.  
  - Sensory toys and low-level equipment.  
  - Rocking chairs for caregivers.

## 3. Pre-Opening Safety Checks

Before any child enters the play areas:

1. **Visual sweep**  
   - Check floors for debris and tripping hazards.  
   - Inspect climber, slides, and pods for damage or loose parts.

2. **Sanitization status**  
   - Confirm that toys and high-touch surfaces have been cleaned per schedule.

3. **Gate / access control**  
   - Verify that gates, if present, latch properly.  
   - Verify fencing or low barriers are intact.

4. **Supplies check**  
   - Bandages, wipes, tissues, gloves.  
   - Cleaning supplies in approved storage (out of kids’ reach).

   - Ensure your device is charged and working.  
   - Quick check-in with Host and Manager.

## 4. Active Supervision Standards

- Maintain **constant scanning** – eyes on moving children, not on phone.  
- Position yourself to see:
  - High-risk areas (climber, slides).  
  - Entrances/exits to play zones.

- **Engagement**:
  - Initiate light play and conversation to build trust.
  - Help children enter ongoing play (especially shy ones).
  - Model gentle behavior and sharing.

- **Behavior guidance**:
  - Use clear, calm language.
  - If behavior is unsafe (pushing, climbing on rails, etc.), intervene quickly:
    - “Feet on the floor, please.”  
    - “We go down the slide, not up.”

- Call parents to re-engage if:
  - A child is repeatedly disregarding rules.
  - A child is inconsolable or distressed.

---

## 5. Capacity & Age Guidelines

- Follow posted **maximum occupancy** for each room.
- Observe age guidance:
  - Under-2 room should be limited to babies/toddlers within posted age range.  
  - Older children should only enter baby room if allowed and closely supervised by their adult.

If capacity is reached:

- Inform Host so they can update the waitlist.
- Politely explain to new arrivals that you’ll allow entry once space opens.

---

## 6. Health & Illness

- Watch for:
  - Persistent coughing, obvious fever, vomiting, or other illness signs.
- If you suspect a child is too ill to remain:
  - Gently notify the parent.
  - If necessary, ask Manager to support the conversation.

We are not diagnosing; we are enforcing a safe environment consistent with posted policies.

## 7. Incident Response

**Minor bumps and scrapes**

1. Stay calm, get to the child quickly.  
2. Assess: scrape vs more serious injury.  
3. Comfort child, clean and bandage minor wounds where allowed by policy.  
4. Notify the parent in person and log in the incident book if required.

**More serious incidents (head hits, possible fractures, breathing issues, etc.)**

1. Call Manager immediately (or Host if Manager not visible), using radio if available.  
2. Ask another staff member to manage the rest of the room while you stay with the child.  
3. Manager or designated staff will decide on calling EMS / 911.  
4. Complete a detailed incident report as soon as safely possible.

---

## 8. Parent / Caregiver Communication

- Be approachable and factual:
  - “I noticed Ava was getting a bit overwhelmed near the climber, so we moved her to the reading corner.”
- If there’s conflict between children:
  - Focus on behavior and safety, not blame.
  - Involve both caregivers if needed, with Manager support.

---

## 9. End-of-Day Tasks

- Tidy and reset toys to designated zones.  
- Remove broken or questionable items from circulation.  
- Wipe down surfaces and high-touch areas per cleaning checklist.  
- Report:
  - Any equipment damage.  
  - Repeated safety issues.  
  - Supply needs (wipes, tissues, etc.).
