# Franchisee Economics Summary

- **Build-out cost ranges**: Vary by size—from compact urban (~$1.2–$1.5M) to neighborhood (~$1.6–$2.0M) to flagship-scale (~$2.0–$2.4M+).
  - Assumes TI/landlord allowances offset 10–20% of build-out; add contingency of 5–10% for permitting delays or equipment lead times.
- **Ramp-up timeline**: Expect 3–6 months from lease to opening with appropriate pre-opening marketing.
  - Critical path: landlord work letter, permit submission/approval, play structure fabrication, and IT/security install.
- **Performance goals**: Target healthy cash-on-cash returns with payback in 3–5 years depending on capital stack and local rent.
  - Break-even volume generally reached at ~60–70% of steady-state monthly revenue; monitor labor and COGS to maintain margin glide path.
- **Staffing model**: Lean operating teams with cross-trained hosts, play attendants, cafe staff, and a manager/owner-operator.
  - Owner-operator or GM anchors hiring and QA; add part-time bench for weekends/parties to protect service levels.
- **Working capital**: Recommend 3–4 months of operating expenses reserved at opening to cover ramp plus marketing, training travel, and deposits for key vendors (POS, insurance, utilities).
- **Unit expansion path**: Encourage multi-unit development agreements (2–3 units) where demographic density and household income support clustering to share management and training resources.
