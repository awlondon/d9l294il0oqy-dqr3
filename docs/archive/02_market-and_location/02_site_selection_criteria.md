# Site Selection Criteria – Co.work.PLAY Cafe

## 1. Overall Strategy

We aim to locate Co.work.PLAY in **family-dense, remote-work-heavy** neighborhoods with:

- Sufficient affluence to support memberships.  
- Strong daytime and weekend demand.  
- Safe, comfortable access for adults with children.

The Phoenix flagship is the prototype; criteria here guide both **flagship** and **franchise** site selection.

## 2. Trade Area Demographics

Ideal primary trade area (10–15 minute drive time):

- High concentration of:
  - Households with children aged 0–8.  
  - Dual-income or professional households.  
- Median household income at or above local metro median.  
- Presence of remote / hybrid workers (proxy: occupations in tech, creative, professional services).

Supportive signals:

- Nearby preschools and elementary schools.  
- High rates of participation in kids’ activities (sports, enrichment, etc.).

## 3. Location & Access

Preferred attributes:

- **Visibility**
  - Street-facing, with signage opportunities visible to drive-by and local traffic.
  - Ideally near major arterial or collector roads.

- **Access**
  - Easy car access with simple turns and signalized intersections where possible.  
  - Safe, convenient pedestrian access for strollers (sidewalks, crossings).

- **Parking**
  - Ample surface parking or structured parking with stroller-friendly access.  
  - Parents must feel comfortable navigating with kids and gear.

## 4. Co-Tenancy & Center Type

Ideal co-tenants include:

- Family-oriented uses:
  - Grocery (e.g., mid- to upper-tier),  
  - Pediatric clinics,  
  - Kids’ enrichment centers,  
  - Fitness studios,  
  - Family restaurants.

Preferred center types:

- Neighborhood and community centers with strong daily-needs traffic.  
- Lifestyle centers in affluent areas (for flagship/destination formats).  

Avoid:

- Centers dominated by heavy late-night bar/club activity.  
- Locations with persistent safety or crime concerns.

## 5. Physical Space Requirements

Minimum for flagship:

- **Size**: 7,500–9,000 SF (target ~8,500 SF).  
- **Configuration**:
  - Rectangular or near-rectangular footprint.
  - Minimum width and depth to allow the three-band layout:
    - Adult zone / Family core / Service spine.
- **Ceiling height**:
  - Preferably 12'–16' clear in main play areas.
- **Column layout**:
  - Column spacing that allows open play sections (limit intrusive columns in center of play area).

Other considerations:

- Ability to vent kitchen / cafe equipment as needed.  
- Existing restrooms that can be reconfigured or expanded.  
- Capacity for adequate HVAC, including additional loads from play + cafe.

---

## 6. Lease Economics & Incentives

Target economics (to be refined with local brokers):

- Competitive base rent for the submarket (not the absolute top of market).  
- Reasonable CAM / NNN charges.

Preferred:

- **Tenant improvement (TI) allowances** from landlord.  
- Initial rent abatement during build-out and ramp-up.  
- Flexible lease term with options (e.g., 10-year base with renewal options).

We prioritize sites where:

- The **total occupancy cost** (rent + NNN) stays within our financial model thresholds as a percentage of revenue.

---

## 7. Intangibles & Qualitative Fit

- Neighborhood vibe matches the brand:
  - Safe, welcoming, not overly industrial or “rough.”  
  - Feels like a place parents want to linger with kids.

- Good **daytime activation**:
  - Offices, schools, and households generate demand during the day.  

- Future-proof:
  - Area shows signs of stable or growing population and incomes, not rapid decline.

These criteria should be used as a checklist when evaluating candidate sites and in broker briefs.
