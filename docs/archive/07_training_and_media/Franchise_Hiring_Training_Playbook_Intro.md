## 2. Concept & Staffing Overview

### 2.1 What We’re Staffing For

Co.work.play Café is a **hybrid space**:

- A **café** with high-quality coffee, snacks, and light meals.  
- A **cowork environment** with Wi-Fi, power, and quiet zones.  
- A **supervised play space** for young children (toddlers to early elementary), with a separate under-2 / sensory room.

We primarily serve:

- Remote and hybrid **working parents**, especially mothers.  
- Extended caregivers (fathers, grandparents, aunts/uncles, nannies).  
- Families who need flexible, high-quality support (not full daycare, but real help).

To make this work, every store needs a team that can:

- Keep children **safe and engaged**.  
- Keep adults **welcomed and productive**.  
- Run the café and facility with **professional, repeatable operations**.

### 2.2 Core Roles

For most stores (including the flagship), the core roles are:

- **Manager / Shift Lead**  
  - Owns daily operations, staffing, and guest experience.  
  - Primary contact to franchisor / HQ.  

- **Host / Front-of-House**  
  - First and last impression.  
  - Manages check-in, memberships, guest day passes, and basic orientation.  

- **Play Attendant**  
  - Supervises the play and baby/sensory areas.  
  - Conducts safety checks, manages behavior, and communicates with parents.  

- **Café Operator / Barista**  
  - Prepares beverages and food.  
  - Maintains café standards and supports the atmosphere for working adults.  

- **Support/Flex Team Member**  
  - Floats between Host, Play, and Café.  
  - Handles resets, cleaning, and simple tasks in each zone as trained.

Each role has its own **SOP** and **training modules** that define:

- What “good” looks like.  
- What they must know before serving guests.  
- How they’re evaluated and signed off.

## 3. Timeline & Milestones

Co.work.play uses a relative timeline to keep planning simple:

- **T-6**: 6 months before scheduled opening  
- **T0**: Opening month  
- **T+1**: 1 month after opening  

You can shift these relative markers to actual dates once your lease and build-out schedule are confirmed.

### 3.1 High-Level Staffing & Training Timeline

| Workstream                     | T-6 | T-5 | T-4 | T-3 | T-2 | T-1 | T0  | T+1 |

**How to use this chart:**

- In your internal spreadsheet or slide, replace “X” with colored blocks to show active periods.
- Use this as a **non-negotiable checklist**: if you compress timelines, identify which items are at most risk (e.g., training depth, soft openings).

### 3.2 Role-Based View

You can also view the timeline by role:

| Role / Focus                        | T-6 | T-5 | T-4 | T-3 | T-2 | T-1 | T0  | T+1 |
