# Design Documentation Index (legacy alias)

This folder remains as a legacy alias while design content is consolidated into [`../03_architecture_and_design/`](../03_architecture_and_design/). Use the canonical folder for new work and reference the documents there to keep design, brand, and operational notes linked.

- **Toddler Play Area Program:** Detailed narrative and bullet-point program for the toddler play room and adjacent under-2/sensory room, including zoning, furnishings, materials, acoustics, lighting, and safety/hygiene considerations.
