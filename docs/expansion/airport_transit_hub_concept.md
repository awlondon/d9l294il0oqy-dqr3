# Airport / Transit Hub Concept – Future Exploration

## Purpose

This document describes a future **Co.work.PLAY Express** concept for international airports and major transit hubs. It is **not part of the near-term rollout plan** and should be treated as a Phase 3–4 exploration, once the core flagship and neighborhood models are proven.

## Strategic Role

- High-visibility brand showcase in international airports / major hubs.
- Short-stay, high-traffic “express” version of the concept:
  - Focus on 30–90 minute dwell times.
  - Emphasis on “burn off energy before the flight” + quick parent reset, more than deep work.
- Acts as:
  - Brand billboard and acquisition funnel for city locations.
  - Possible premium-priced, short-stay product.

## Fit vs. Core Model

Core Co.work.PLAY (current focus):

- Longer stays (2–4 hours, repeat weekly users).
- Neighborhood/community retail centers near dense young-family zones.
- Membership-centric, with some day passes.
- Full cowork zone + play area + cafe, optimized for “serious work + supervised play.”

Airport / Transit Hub Co.work.PLAY Express (future):

- Shorter stays (30–90 minutes, unpredictable arrival/exit times).
- Mostly transient travelers with kids.
- Simpler, high-throughput F&B menu.
- Smaller cowork component; more emphasis on:
  - Secure, contained play zone.
  - Soft seating and device-friendly spots for parents.
- Likely more day-pass and per-visit pricing; limited role for full memberships.

## Major Challenges & Constraints

- Very high rents and complex concessionaire / airport authority relationships.
- Strict security, safety, and operations requirements.
- Strong need to avoid being misinterpreted as a “drop-off daycare”:
  - Clear rules that caregivers must stay on-site and within the facility.
  - Strict adult–child ratio guidelines.
- Operational complexity in a high-traffic, high-noise environment.

## Timing & Prerequisites

The airport concept should be treated as **Phase 3–4**:

- Only considered after:
  - Multiple core flagships are open and performing (e.g., Phoenix + additional metros).
  - Neighborhood / urban units in several markets demonstrate consistent economics.
  - Systems for safety, training, and F&B are stable and scalable.

Suggested timeline:

- **Years 1–3:** Phoenix flagship + regional neighborhood sites (core model only).
- **Years 3–7:** Expand core model to 20–40+ units in top family/remote-work metros.
- **Years 7–10+:** Explore 1–2 pilot **Co.work.PLAY Express** units at airports / major transit hubs with a specialized operator or concessionaire partner.

## Next Steps (Future)

For later exploration, not for current execution:

- Identify candidate airports with:
  - Strong family travel volume.
  - Existing “kids’ play” or “family lounge” programs as comparables.
- Define a dedicated program brief:
  - Reduced cowork area; increased flexible seating.
  - Highly simplified menu.
  - Strict policies on caregiver presence and child supervision.
- Model airport-specific unit economics:
  - High rent + % of gross.
  - Higher pricing for short stays.
  - Dense staffing for throughput and cleaning.
