# Layout and Flow Notes

- **Left zone**: Café and cowork areas with barista bar and a mix of soft seating and work tables.
- **Center**: Entry/host podium, main toddler play hall, and adjacent baby/under-2 room for clear visibility from seating.
- **Right zone**: Bar and multi-use/party room; restrooms and back-of-house tucked behind controlled doors.
- **Circulation**: Single controlled entry with wristband check; stroller parking near the front; staff sightlines across all play zones.
- **References**: Link floorplan PDFs placed in `design/floorplans/` for diagrams, furnished layout, and dense seating options.
