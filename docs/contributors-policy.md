# Contributors Program Policy

## Purpose
Offer an ethical, voluntary way for community members to contribute skills or time.

## Data model
- `contributors` and optional `perks` tables (see `docs/tech/membership-and-access.md`).

## Sign-up and approval
- Simple form collects what they want to offer and preferred frequency.
- Admin reviews for safety, fit, and scheduling before approving.
- Contributors can pause or stop at any time with no penalty.

## Perks
- Flat, modest rewards (coffee, hour of play, small discount on a day pass).
- No ranks, tiers, or inner-circle labels.

## Guardrails
- Participation is optional and **not** required for membership or access.
- No shaming or pressure to volunteer; opt-in only.
- Keep workloads reasonable; rotate tasks to avoid burnout.
