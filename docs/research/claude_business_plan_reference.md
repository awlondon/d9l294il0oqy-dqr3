# Claude Business Plan – Reference Only

> This document captures an AI-generated business plan scenario for Co.work.PLAY Café. It is useful as a structural reference (section organization, example numbers), but **it does not reflect our canonical assumptions** about square footage, CapEx, launch date, or target margins. Our official flagship model is documented in the `docs/business/` and `docs/finance/` sections.
>
> The following is preserved for comparison and inspiration. Where numbers or assumptions conflict with our main plan, **our plan overrides it**.

> **Reference content note:** The full Claude plan text was not included in the current repository materials. Insert the complete AI-generated plan here (Executive Summary, Market, Business Model, Unit Economics, Risks, Marketing, 90-day plan, Tech Stack, Franchise) when available so that readers can compare it to our canonical model.
