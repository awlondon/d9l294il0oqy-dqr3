# Phoenix Flagship Unit Economics (v2 – Canonical)

## Overview

This document defines the **official** unit economics for the Phoenix-area flagship Co.work.PLAY Café. It supersedes any placeholder numbers in earlier drafts and incorporates lessons from the Claude reference model, but uses our **realistic assumptions**:

- **Flagship size:** ~8,500 sq ft (neighborhood/community retail center)
- **Target opening:** Early 2026 (Phoenix metro)
- **CapEx (total project cost):** ≈ $2.2M
- **Concept:** Membership-first, host-gated, acoustically insulated toddler play + cowork + café, with franchise-prototype quality design.

## Revenue Streams (Mature Year – Phoenix Flagship)

- **Memberships (primary):**
  - 3–4 tiers with defined session caps (no truly unlimited tier).
  - Add-on pricing per extra child.
  - Tiered café discounts linked to membership level.
- **Day Passes:**
  - Half-day and full-day pricing for adult + child.
  - Premium positioning vs a standard café; below full-time daycare costs.
- **Café & Food:**
  - Specialty coffee, beverages, pastries, light meals.
  - Average ticket per visit (to be calibrated).
- **Events & Parties:**
  - Weekend birthday parties, private rentals, workshops.

> **Note:** Detailed per-tier pricing and volume assumptions should be modeled in an attached spreadsheet or a separate `pricing_model.md`. This doc captures the high-level structure and target margin ranges.

## Key Assumptions (Update as Needed)

- Members: [TODO – target average mature membership count, e.g., 350–450 households]
- Average membership ARPU: [TODO – monthly]
- Day pass visits per month: [TODO – baseline + stretch]
- Average café ticket: [TODO – $X–$Y]
- Party/event revenue: [TODO – monthly average]

## Monthly Revenue Breakdown (Target Structure)

- Memberships: ~55–65% of total revenue
- Day passes: ~10–20%
- Café/F&B: ~15–25%
- Events/parties: ~5–10%

These ranges are more conservative than the Claude reference (which assumed 70% memberships and a small event share) and will be refined as we gather real-world data.

## Monthly Operating Costs (Mature Store)

- **Rent:**  
  - Based on ~8,500 sq ft in a quality Phoenix-area center.  
  - Assumption: $[TODO]/sq ft/year + CAMS → target $[TODO]/month.
- **Staff:**  
  - General Manager  
  - Shift Leads  
  - Hosts  
  - Play Attendants (multiple)  
  - Café Operators (baristas, prep, runners)  
  - Admin/cleaning coverage  
- **F&B COGS:**  
  - Target COGS % for coffee/food.
- **Utilities & Internet**
- **Insurance**
- **Supplies & Cleaning**
- **Marketing**
- **Software/Tech**
- **Maintenance & Repairs**

> Insert actual baseline monthly cost estimates here (rent, wages, etc.) as they become available from real bids and pro formas.

## Target Store-Level EBITDA

- **Goal range:** 20–30% store-level EBITDA once mature.
- This is intentionally more conservative than the 44–54% range in the Claude reference plan.
- We will adjust expectations based on:
  - Real rent and wage data,
  - Actual membership and F&B performance,
  - Operational efficiency over time.

## CapEx Summary (Phoenix Flagship)

Total estimated project cost: **≈ $2.2M**

- Architecture & design (incl. BRR fees): [TODO – $X]
- Tenant improvement & buildout: [TODO – $X]
- Indoor play village & under-2 room equipment: [TODO – $X]
- Café equipment (espresso, refrigeration, prep): [TODO – $X]
- Furniture, fixtures, décor: [TODO – $X]
- Technology (POS, ordering system, WiFi, initial AI stack): [TODO – $X]
- Pre-opening staff & training: [TODO – $X]
- Pre-opening marketing: [TODO – $X]
- Working capital & contingency: [TODO – $X]

## Comparison to Claude Reference Plan

See: `../research/claude_business_plan_reference.md` for the original AI-generated unit economics. That model assumed:

- 6,000 sq ft
- $450–550k CapEx
- $1.9M annual revenue with 44–54% EBITDA

We **explicitly treat those figures as non-canonical**. Our flagship will be larger, more capital-intensive, and targeted at more realistic margins.
