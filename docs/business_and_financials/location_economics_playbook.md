# Location Economics Playbook

A quick filter to decide whether a prospective site pencils before committing to LOI.

## Rent & Occupancy Guardrails
- **Target rent range:** $22–$28/SF NNN for flagship-scale spaces; $18–$24/SF for smaller/secondary markets.
- **Size:** 10,000–14,000 SF target; divisible zones for cowork, cafe, under-2, party rooms, and storage.
- **Escalations & TI:** Aim for ≤3% annual escalations; negotiate TI to cover 20–30% of build-out and extended free rent through inspections.
- **CAM/NNN:** Validate controllable vs. uncontrollable expenses; require caps where possible.

## Demand Drivers
- **Household density & income:** 2k+ households within 1 mile and 20k+ within 3 miles; median HH income $110k+.
- **Remote/Hybrid workers:** Strong presence of remote workers, cowork adoption, and employer clusters that can sponsor memberships.
- **Family mix:** High concentration of 0–8 year-old households; proximity to preschools/elementary schools.
- **Daytime anchors:** Grocery-anchored centers or mixed-use nodes with daily footfall; easy parking and stroller-friendly access.

## Fit to Multi-Metro Plan
- **Territory strategy:** Sits within priority metros called out in the 100-store plan; preserves white space for 2–5 units per metro.
- **Competitive scan:** Inventory indoor play, childcare-adjacent, cowork, and cafe peers; model share capture by visit type.
- **Community partnerships:** Access to schools/PTAs, pediatric practices, HR leaders, and local employers for corporate bundles.

## Go/No-Go Checklist
- Rents within guardrails after CAM/NNN and escalation.
- Sufficient remote-worker and young-family density to hit membership ramp assumptions.
- Parking, access, and visibility support stroller-heavy traffic.
- Landlord open to TI/free rent to offset build-out and pre-opening training window.
- Meets zoning and use allowances for cafe + assembly + play.
