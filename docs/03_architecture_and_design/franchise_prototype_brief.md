# Franchise Prototype Brief

## Purpose
Provide scalable program guidance for franchise formats: Small (4–5k SF), Medium (6–7k SF), and Large (8–9k SF).

## Format Overview
| Component | Small (4–5k SF) | Medium (6–7k SF) | Large (8–9k SF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cafe & Seating | Compact bar, 24–30 seats; focus on speed | Full bar, 40–50 seats, dual makeline | Full cafe, 60+ seats, dual makeline + grab-and-go wall |
| Cowork | 12–16 seats, 1 phone booth | 24–30 seats, 3–4 phone booths, 1–2 meeting rooms | 40+ seats, 6 booths, 3 meeting rooms |
| Play (2–5) | 800–1,000 SF structure | 1,200–1,400 SF with gross-motor + imaginative zones | 1,600+ SF with zoning and climbing feature |
| Under-2 | Soft corner or 150–200 SF room | 250–300 SF dedicated room | 350–400 SF calming room |
| Party/Flex | 1 combined party/class room (350–400 SF) | 1 party room + flex class area (500–600 SF total) | 600 SF party studio; flex class space |
| Support/BOH | 700–850 SF | 900–1,100 SF | 1,200–1,400 SF |
| Restrooms | 2 family + 1 staff | 2 family + 1 staff | 3 family + 1 staff |

## Program Notes
- Maintain clear sightlines from host to play entry regardless of format.
- Use the same FF&E kit-of-parts; scale quantity, not character.
- Small format prioritizes throughput: smaller party schedule, limited meeting rooms; focus on memberships + cafe.
- Medium format mirrors financial model in `franchise_business_model.md` and `financial_summary_tables.md`.
- Large format aligns to Phoenix flagship, with added party capacity and collaboration tables for micro teams.

## Adaptable Elements
- **Play structure modules:** Choose compact vs. expanded climber based on ceiling height; always include soft flooring and headcount signage.
- **Cafe equipment:** Single vs. dual espresso/PUC; hot-holding or speed ovens added for medium/large only.
- **Acoustics:** Add suspended baffles above play in small format to maintain calm in tighter footprint.
- **Meeting rooms:** Prioritize 1 room in small; add second in medium if demand proven; full stack in large.

## Deliverables for Architects
- Prototype plans for each size with furniture counts and clear egress.
- Finish legend showing required vs. optional upgrades.
- MEP notes for cafe, laundry, and play equipment power/water needs.
- Security/IT plan: access control at entries, CCTV coverage, Wi-Fi and POS drops.
