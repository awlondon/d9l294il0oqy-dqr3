## Purpose
Guide architects and interior designers on program mix, space allocations, and experiential priorities for the Phoenix flagship.

## Space Program & Approximate SF

- **Phone Booths:** 6 units at ~25 SF each (150 SF total) with ventilation and acoustic seals.
- **Meeting Rooms:** Three rooms (2x 8–10p, 1x 12p) totaling ~550 SF; AV-equipped.
- **Play Zone (2–5):** 1,600 SF with climbing structure, slides, imaginative play, and soft flooring.

- **Back-of-House:** 1,250 SF; prep/commissary, dry/cold storage, laundry, staff break, IT closet, janitorial, trash route.

## Adjacency Priorities
- Host stand aligned with entry and direct view to play entry gate.
- Café adjacent to cowork and visible from play for easy ordering; avoid smells/noise bleeding into play.
- Play entry controlled with single access gate near host; restrooms located along play edge for quick supervision.
- Party studio near play but acoustically separated; direct path to storage and janitorial.
- BOH separated from guest flow with discreet loading route.

## Experience & Operational Cues
- **Zoning:** Acoustical separation between cowork/café and play; ceiling treatments and soft surfaces to control noise.
- **Safety:** Rounded edges, tamper-proof outlets, ADA routes, and CCTV coverage of entry/exit points.
- **Visibility:** Low partitions for adult sightlines into play; mirrors or glazing at key corners.
- **Cleanability:** Washable finishes, removable play elements for sanitizing, handwash/sanitizer stations at entries.
- **Technology:** Enterprise Wi-Fi with coverage in play and cowork; access control at entries; AV in meeting rooms.

## Aesthetic Direction
Warm modern with biophilic touches: light woods, muted greens/blues, textured acoustic panels, and soft curves. Avoid cartoon themes; layer subtle play cues through shapes and lighting.

## Deliverables Requested
- Test-fit options for 8,000–9,000 SF in-line shell with 20–25’ clear heights.
- Reflected ceiling and lighting plan emphasizing zones and dimmability.
- Material/finish boards aligned to cleaning requirements and brand palette.
- Furniture/FF&E schedule with kid-proof options and ADA compliance.
- Phasing plan for construction and early equipment ordering.
