# Co.work.PLAY Café – Phoenix Flagship Architecture Design Brief

## Project overview

**Concept** – Co.work.PLAY Café blends a specialty café, a coworking lounge, and a supervised toddler play environment into a single facility. The flagship in Phoenix, Arizona will act both as a premium location and as the prototype for eventual franchise roll-out. The facility is a place where caregivers can complete serious work while their toddlers are cared for in a safe, enriching environment. The project aims to create a destination that balances family wellness, community engagement, and an inviting hospitality vibe.

**Mission** – Empower remote-working parents and families by providing a clean, safe, and acoustically insulated play space for young children (ages 6 months–4 years) while offering a quiet and professional workspace, high-quality coffee, and health-minded food. The brand intends to de-emphasize the founders and highlight local owners as community anchors.

**Prototype strategy** – Build an 8,500–9,000 ft² tenant improvement in a neighborhood or community retail center, then document every standard (finish palettes, FF&E, play equipment modules, signage, and wayfinding) for a franchising kit. A training team at the flagship will support future franchisees.

## Site selection & layout

### Proposed Phoenix location

**Neighborhood** – Target Arcadia, Biltmore, Chandler, or Scottsdale submarkets. These areas have concentrations of young families and remote-working professionals and offer relatively high disposable incomes. Sites should be within mixed-use centers or community shopping plazas with good parking, pedestrian safety, and visibility.

**Size & configuration** – The flagship will occupy ≈ 8,500 ft² (including back-of-house). A storefront with high glass allows natural light; entries should face parking with an accessible drop-off zone. A rear service entrance is needed for deliveries and waste management.

**Adjacency** – The café and cowork space front the main circulation path. Behind a glazed partition sits the toddler play village and a separate under-2 sensory room. The party/multi-use room flanks the play area for rentals and classes. A back-of-house block houses kitchen, storage, mechanical, staff offices, and break rooms.

### Schematic program areas (approximate)

| Zone | Area (ft²) | Key features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry & Host Station | 300 | Check-in desk, member services, security gate, stroller parking, and cubbies. Hosts control access and verify memberships. |
| Café & Food Service | 1,200 | Espresso bar, pastry/lunch display, prep area (no full cooking), POS pick-up. Beverage equipment, refrigeration, and dishwashing areas. |
| Cowork Area | 2,200 | ~40 workstation seats with power and data, 2–3 phone pods, small meeting room, communal tables, and soft seating. Visual connection to the play zone via acoustic glass. |
| Toddler Play Village | 2,100 | Low climbers, slides, pretend play corners (kitchen, market, workshop), reading nook, art tables, cubby storage. Flooring is impact-rated; fixtures anchored; clear sightlines. |
| Under-2 Sensory Room | 400 | Soft mats, mirrors, wobble cushions, textures, and low-stimulus lighting. Separated from the main play zone for infants/toddlers. |
| Party/Multi-Use Room | 500 | Flexible space for birthday parties, classes, and events. Integrated storage for tables/chairs and A/V. |
| Back-of-House | 1,100 | Staff lounge, office, storage, janitorial, mechanical, dry goods, and receiving. |

## Design considerations

### Safety & licensing

**Non-daycare supervised play** – Arizona allows unlicensed “child play centers” where children are supervised for short periods when the parent or guardian remains on the premises and is immediately accessible. These facilities may not advertise themselves as childcare centers and must limit the duration of care (often < 4 hours). Key requirements include clear parental responsibility statements, posted operational policies, and emergency procedures. Local building officials may classify the play area as assembly/mercantile rather than daycare.

**Regulatory comparisons** – Many other states (e.g., Texas, Colorado, Oregon) apply similar rules for “drop-in play care” or “parent on premises” exceptions. Texas exempts certain supervised play centers if parents are in the same building and care is limited to less than 10 hours per week per child. Colorado provides exemptions for parent-supervised “recreation centers” where drop-off does not exceed 3 hours per day. Each jurisdiction has its own definitions for time limits and age ranges, so future franchise documents must include state-by-state compliance guides.

**Safety protocols** – All staff must be background checked; at least one CPR/First-Aid certified attendant per shift. Occupant loads should meet building code (fire occupancy, egress widths, restroom counts). Emergency exits must be alarmed and visible. Indoor play equipment should be certified by a recognized manufacturer and installed per ASTM F2373 standards (soft contained playground equipment for children aged 2 and younger) and ASTM F1918 (age 2–12). Play surfaces should meet impact attenuation requirements (ASTM F1292) and be non-slip. Visual supervision is essential; the design should avoid blind spots.

### Materials & finishes

**Flooring** – In the play village, use cushioned rubber or poured-in-place safety surfacing meeting impact standards. In the cowork area, acoustic carpet tiles for noise absorption and comfort. Café and circulation spaces may use durable polished concrete or commercial LVT with slip resistance.

**Walls & partitions** – Half-height walls clad in high-pressure laminate or impact-resistant paneling protect from collisions. Tempered safety glass partitions separate play and cowork areas for acoustic control while maintaining sightlines. Acoustic felt panels on ceilings and upper walls help reduce noise.

**Fixtures & equipment** – All play structures should have rounded edges, no entrapment points, and secure anchoring. Furnishings in the cowork area should be commercial-grade and easy to clean; avoid fabrics that absorb stains. Café requires NSF-approved prep surfaces and an under-counter dishwasher. Provide bottle warmers and microwaves for parents.

**HVAC & air quality** – Ensure zoning so the play area receives adequate fresh air without compromising temperature comfort. Consider HEPA filtration. Restrooms should include child-sized fixtures and baby-changing stations. Touch-free faucets and dispensers reduce germ transmission.

**Lighting** – Use warm, dimmable LED fixtures throughout. Provide brighter lighting in active play zones and softer lighting in reading and nursing areas. Avoid glare; incorporate skylights where possible. For example, creative indoor play cafes often integrate large windows and natural wood finishes to create inviting environments[1].

### Security & tech integration

**Check-in** – A digital host system verifies memberships, manages seat assignments, and logs children by name and guardian. This data drives safety and helps maintain staffing ratios. Approved caregivers (nannies, grandparents) can be linked to multiple children with parental consent.

**Seat-based ordering** – Workstations have QR codes or tablets enabling members to order coffee and food from their seats. Orders integrate with the café POS and kitchen display system. Runners deliver items along clear lanes to avoid crossing the play area.

**AI & monitoring** – Long-term, the plan calls for AI-GM (AI general manager) systems to monitor noise levels, occupancy, and equipment status. Biometric login for members or optional security features may be considered in later phases but are not needed at launch. All cameras must follow privacy guidelines and not film restrooms or nursing areas.

### Community & wellness

**Programming** – Offer parent education workshops, lactation support, pediatrician talks, weekend family activities, and toddler classes. Host monthly member events to build community and encourage retention.

**Culture** – Staff should be trained in positive behavior guidance and inclusive language. Emphasize a judgment-free atmosphere: caregivers are here because they choose to be here, not because they have no other option.

**Accessibility** – Provide stroller-friendly entries, ADA-compliant circulation and seating, and accessible restrooms. Use signage in multiple languages where relevant.

## Financials & next steps

**Indicative costs** – The flagship is expected to require approximately US $2.2 million in total project cost. This includes architecture & engineering, tenant improvement, high-quality play equipment and finishes, café equipment, design and marketing fees, pre-opening payroll, and working capital.

**Revenue model** – Primary revenue stems from memberships (monthly packages that bundle play/work sessions and café discounts). Secondary revenue includes day passes, café sales, and events. We anticipate a membership penetration of 300–400 households in year 1 with day-pass traffic and event bookings adding incremental revenue.

**Payback** – Based on a revenue target of ≈ US $2.5 million annually and assuming 20–30% store-level EBITDA, the flagship could reach payback within 3–4 years. Final numbers depend on lease terms, financing costs, and membership ramp-up.

## Deliverables for BRR

- Review this brief and note any questions about program, adjacencies, or scope.
- Provide a preliminary test fit for one or two candidate sites (8,500–9,000 ft²). Include alternative layouts (e.g., dense cowork seating vs. open lounge) and highlight structural modifications needed.
- Prepare an early cost estimate and timeline for design development, permitting, and construction based on local codes.
- Advise on local building and health department permitting for unlicensed supervised play vs. daycare classification, including restroom counts and occupancy loads. Compare to other states for future franchising.
- Outline additional services available (interior design, FF&E specification, signage and environmental graphics, franchise prototyping kit).

## Summary

The Co.work.PLAY Café flagship in Phoenix aims to set a new standard for remote-work–friendly family spaces. The design must prioritize safety, cleanliness, and community while delivering a premium hospitality experience. By partnering with BRR Architecture, we expect to refine the spatial program, navigate Arizona’s regulatory environment for supervised play, and develop a prototype that can be repeated across other markets. This brief provides the foundation for that collaboration.
