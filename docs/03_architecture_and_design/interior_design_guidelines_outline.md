# Interior Design Guidelines Outline

## Purpose
Provide the structure for detailed finish, FF&E, and brand environment standards to be expanded for each project and franchise release.

## Document Structure
1. **Brand Overview**
   - Concept summary and experience pillars.
   - Mood boards and reference imagery.
2. **Space Planning Principles**
   - Sightlines from host to play; ADA and stroller circulation.
   - Acoustic zoning between cafe/cowork and play.
   - Toddler play room zoning follows [Toddler Play Area – Design Program & Narrative](../design/toddler_play_area_program.md): climb/slide zone, pretend play, activity tables, reading/calm corner, and adjacent under-2/sensory room.
3. **Finish Standards**
   - Floors: resilient plank in cafe/cowork, rubberized in play, tile in restrooms.
   - Walls: washable paint specs, impact protection at kid-height, accent panels.
   - Ceilings: acoustic baffles over play, wood slats/soft clouds over cafe and cowork.
4. **Millwork & Casework**
   - Cafe bar layout with service heights; lockable undercounter storage.
   - Host stand with check-in tech, cubbies, and stroller/merch integration.
5. **FF&E**
   - Seating typologies (banquettes, stacking chairs, lounge, high chairs), durability criteria, cleanability tests.
   - Play FF&E: modular climbers, soft seating, storage for rotation bins.
   - Meeting room tables, chairs, AV mounts, and cable management.
6. **Lighting & Electrical**
   - Layered lighting, dimming zones, night/security lighting, outlet density at cowork.
   - Emergency lighting and exit signage placement.
7. **Graphics & Wayfinding**
   - Logo usage, color specs, type hierarchy; door and safety signage templates.
   - Wristband/tag colors for adults/children; rules posters near play.
8. **Technology Integration**
   - Wi-Fi access points, POS drops, cameras, access control readers, audio zones.
9. **Safety & Cleanliness**
   - Edge radius standards, anti-tip requirements, lockable storage, handwashing/sanitizer placement.
   - Materials vetting for ASTM/UL compliance for play.
10. **Sustainability & Maintenance**
    - Low-VOC paints, recyclable materials preference, cleaning products compatibility.
11. **Appendices**
    - Approved vendors list, alternates, and substitution process.
    - Sample room finish schedules and equipment cut sheets.

## Usage Notes
- Treat this outline as the table of contents for the full guideline binder.
- Update per release to align with menu changes, supplier shifts, and regional code nuances.
