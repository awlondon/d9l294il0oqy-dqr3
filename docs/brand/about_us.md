# Our Story

## Origin
Co.work.PLAY Café began on November 10, 2025, during a video call between co-founders Alex London and Savannah Strasner. While prompting an AI to imagine a “Phoenix flagship”—a neighborhood café that paired coworking with a supervised toddler play space—they saw how the concept could anchor both a flagship location and a franchise network.

That session produced the first Phoenix flagship renderings and a draft rollout plan for a flagship-plus-franchise model. More importantly, it surfaced a simple insight: remote and hybrid caregivers need a place where real work and real play can coexist, with kids close by and cared for.

By the end of the call, Alex and Savannah had aligned on building Co.work.PLAY Café as a system that any owner-operator could bring to life in their community while preserving safety, hospitality, and a consistent brand promise.

## What We Do
We build cowork cafés with supervised play spaces that let caregivers get meaningful work done while their young children play nearby. Each flagship and franchise location pairs hospitality, safety, and technology to deliver reliable childcare oversight and productive work environments.

## Who We Serve
Remote and hybrid caregivers—especially parents of toddlers—who want a dependable place to focus without being far from their kids. We also serve the local teams who run each location, equipping them with training, tools, and clear standards.

## Where We’re Going
Our first Phoenix flagship is the training ground and proof-of-concept. From there, we will open additional flagships and support locally owned franchises, growing a network of Co.work.PLAY Cafés that keep work and play side by side in communities everywhere.
