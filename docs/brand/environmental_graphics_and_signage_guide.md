# Environmental Graphics and Signage Guide

Key sign types and layout cues for interiors and exterior wayfinding.

## Core Interior Signs
- **House Rules:** Mounted near entry and play zones; concise bullets on wellness, supervision, socks, food zones, and dirty-toy bins.
- **Zone Labels:** Clear labels for Café, Cowork, Play, Under-2, Party Room; include simple icons for quick recognition.
- **Wayfinding:** Arrows to restrooms, nursing room, stroller parking, exits; consistent arrow style and spacing.
- **Capacity/age signs:** Under-2 and party room max capacity and age guidance posted at entrances.

## Design Principles
- Use primary palette backgrounds with high-contrast text; reserve coral for emphasis and warnings.
- Rounded corners and soft shadows to align with brand friendliness.
- Pair icons with short text; avoid more than 6 bullets per sign to preserve readability.
- Materials: durable, wipeable surfaces (laminated, acrylic, or powder-coated metal) suitable for high-touch cleaning.

## Example Layouts
- **House Rules Poster:** 18"x24" portrait, headline “Play Together. Stay Kind.” with five bullets and QR to full policy.
- **Directional Blade Signs:** Double-sided hanging signs for Café and Cowork with icons; mounted above sightlines.
- **Party Room Door:** Frosted vinyl with Party Room icon, capacity line, and “Please check in with host.”

## Installation Notes
- Mount at child-and-parent-friendly heights (house rules at ~60", zone labels at ~54").
- Ensure signage does not create protrusions in tight aisles; follow ADA clearance for wall-mounted signs.
- Coordinate sign locations with lighting to avoid glare; keep consistent margins from door frames and corners.
