# Ownership-First Brand Philosophy

Co.work.PLAY Café exists to be owned, not idolized. The concept was created by co-founders Alexander Warren London and Savannah Strasner, with initial funding support from Michael Strasner, but it is not designed to revolve around any one personality. Our job at the corporate level is to maintain a strong, simple template that works—and then get out of the way.

Franchise owners are the face of Co.work.PLAY Café in their communities. Within our guardrails for safety, brand, and operations, each owner is expected to adapt the model to their local market, take responsibility for performance, and build a team that genuinely wants to be there.

We believe no one should feel “stuck” working in a Co.work.PLAY Café. Leaders and staff are here because they choose to be: they care about families, about creating a calm space in a chaotic world, and about running a professional, sustainable business. The role of the brand is to support that—not to overshadow it.

## Core Takeaways
- The brand de-emphasizes personalities and founders in favor of a durable system.
- Investors and local owners are the primary stewards of how the concept shows up in each market.
- Staff are expected to be here by choice and alignment, not obligation, supported by leaders who honor that commitment.
