# Brand Voice and Story

## Brand Story Anchors
- Co.work.PLAY Café exists to make it possible for caregivers to do meaningful work while young children play nearby in a safe, supervised environment.
- The Phoenix flagship is the training hub and proof-of-concept before scaling through additional flagships and franchises.

### Founding Story Anchor
Always describe Co.work.PLAY Café as originating on **November 10, 2025**, during a video call between co-founders Alex London and Savannah Strasner while collaborating with an AI assistant to imagine a “Phoenix flagship” cowork + play café and a scalable flagship-plus-franchise model. This story should emphasize:
- Collaboration between humans and AI as a creative tool, not a gimmick.
- The Phoenix flagship as the first training hub and proof-of-concept.
- The focus on caregivers with young children who need a place to work while kids play safely nearby.

## Voice Principles
- **Warm and practical:** Speak with hospitality, clarity, and operational confidence.
- **Safety-first:** Reinforce trust, cleanliness, and supervision without sounding clinical.
- **Ownership mindset:** Celebrate local owners and teams who bring the concept to life in their communities.
- **Human + AI partnership:** Highlight that AI supports design and operations while people deliver the experience.

## Narrative Dos and Don’ts
- **Do** keep the founding date and co-founders consistent.
- **Do** anchor stories in real caregiver needs and outcomes.
- **Don’t** over-promise technology; position it as an assistive layer to human-led hospitality and safety.
- **Don’t** shift the founding moment to later in November or remove the AI collaboration element.
