# Logo and Visual Identity Spec

Guidelines for using the Co.work.PLAY Cafe logo across digital and physical touchpoints.

## Logo Usage
- Maintain clear space equal to the height of the “C” around all sides.
- Minimum size: 28px height for digital; 0.75 in height for print.
- Approved lockups: horizontal (preferred for signage) and stacked (for square spaces/app icons).
- Do not stretch, recolor outside palette, or place on cluttered backgrounds.

## Color Palette
- **Primary:** Deep charcoal, soft cream, and accent coral.
- **Secondary:** Sage green, sky blue, warm sand.
- Use high-contrast pairings for accessibility; reserve coral for calls-to-action.

## Typography
- **Headline:** Rounded sans (e.g., Nunito/Manrope) for friendliness and legibility.
- **Body:** Clean sans (e.g., Inter) for readability in long-form and signage.
- **Numerals & Stats:** Monospace or tabular lining numerals for menus and dashboards.

## Applications
- **Exterior sign:** Backlit horizontal lockup with high contrast against facade; follow landlord guidelines.
- **App icon:** Stacked lockup with simplified “CWP” monogram; avoid small taglines.
- **Merch & collateral:** Use primary palette with generous whitespace; keep logo off distressed textures.

## File Handling
- Maintain master vector files (AI/SVG) and exports (PNG/WebP/PDF) in the shared brand drive.
- Provide dark/light versions and single-color options for emboss/deboss.
- Include Figma link to current layouts for designers and vendors.
