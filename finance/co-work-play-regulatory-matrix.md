# Co.Work.Play – Regulatory & Expansion Matrix (Draft)

| State | Category | Childcare/Play Licensing Summary | Estimated Extra CAPEX | Estimated Extra Time to Open | Notes |
|-------|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| AZ    | Light    | Parent-on-site play spaces with supervised attendants may not require full daycare licensing; safety inspections still apply. | +$0–$25k | +0–1 months | Flagship validation state. |
| CA    | Heavy    | Strict childcare licensing; staff credentialing, ratios, and facility requirements likely apply even if parents are on-site. | +$50k–$100k | +2–3 months | May require modified operating model. |
| NY    | Heavy    | Similar to CA; additional fire and egress codes; may need certified childcare staff. | +$50k–$100k | +2–3 months | Target later after brand maturity. |
| CO    | Moderate | Mixed; depends on how “care” vs “supervision” is defined. | +$25k–$50k | +1–2 months | Requires detailed legal review. |
| TX    | Moderate | Some flexibility, but city-by-city enforcement varies. | +$25k–$50k | +1–2 months | Consider parent-on-site / no staff-led care positioning to avoid childcare licensing triggers. |
