# Phoenix Flagship – Timeline & Capital Plan

This document summarizes the target build-out, capital requirements, and validation timeline for the ~8,500 SF Co.Work.Play flagship in Phoenix. It is the primary reference for investors and internal planning.

## 1-Page Investor Snapshot
- Total capital target: **$2.7–3.0M** (CapEx, pre-opening, and runway).
- Phases and timeline: 0–6 months (site/design/capital), 6–12 months (build-out & soft open), 12–18 months (live operations & validation).
- Key validation metrics: day-pass → member conversion, monthly churn, labor %, and play attendant turnover.

## 1. Timeline Overview (18-Month Validation Arc)

We treat Phoenix as a three-phase, ~18-month validation project:

- **Phase 1 (Months 0–6): Site, Design, Capital**
- **Phase 2 (Months 6–12): Build-Out & Soft Opening**
- **Phase 3 (Months 12–18): Live Operations & Validation (no franchise decisions)**

### Phase 1 – Site, Design, Capital (Months 0–6)

- Months 0–2:
  - Finalize concept positioning for Phoenix (e.g., “play-first with strong coffee”).
  - Lock initial capital or credit facility.
  - Shortlist 3–5 candidate sites and run rent/zoning checks.
- Months 2–4:
  - Execute LOI / lease.
  - Engage architect + GC for schematic design based on the 3×3 grid.
  - Start childcare/play + F&B licensing consult with legal (no guessing).
- Months 4–6:
  - Submit permits (building, health, fire, play).
  - Lock in equipment specs (kitchen, cafe, play, AI-GM).
  - Finalize analytics spec (family_id, visit events, membership events, churn tracking).

### Phase 2 – Build-Out & Soft Opening (Months 6–12)

- Months 6–10:
  - Execute leasehold improvements and MEP work.
  - Install kitchen, cafe bar, play equipment, and AI-GM screen network.
  - Hire core leadership: GM, lead barista, lead play attendant.
- Months 10–12:
  - Commissioning and soft open with limited hours.
  - Validate basic operational flow and safety.
  - Ensure all analytics pipelines are live before full opening.

### Phase 3 – Validation Window (Months 12–18)

- Months 12–18:
  - Treat this as a hard validation window:
    - Measure day-pass → member conversion.
    - Track member churn and visit frequency.
    - Monitor labor %, turnover, and cafe vs play economics.
  - No franchise commitments until 6 months of stable data from Phoenix.

## 2. Capital Plan for Phoenix (~8,500 SF)

We plan around three main capital buckets:

1. Build-Out & Equipment (CapEx)
2. Pre-Opening Costs
3. Operating Runway (Post-Opening)

### 2.1 Build-Out & Equipment (CapEx)

For ~8,500 SF:

- Leasehold improvements (TI): **$150–$200/ft²**
  - ~8,500 ft² → **$1.3–1.7M**
- Cafe + kitchen equipment:
  - Full espresso bar + kitchen line → **$250–350k**
- Play equipment & safety:
  - Soft play, flooring, install → **$50–100k**
- Furniture, fixtures, lighting (FF&E):
  - Workstations, soft seating, party room, lighting → **$150–250k**
- AI-GM hardware:
  - Screens, mounts, media players, rack (UPS, switch, NAS) → **$20–40k**

**CapEx midpoint estimate:** ≈ **$2.1M**

### 2.2 Pre-Opening Costs

- Design, legal, licensing, pre-opening payroll, and launch marketing:
  - Estimated **$200–300k**, midpoint **$250k**.

### 2.3 Operating Runway (Post-Opening)

We assume:

- Full-load monthly fixed cost: **~$180–220k**
- Early months can be **$60–100k/month cash negative** during ramp.

We target **6–9 months of operating reserve** at this burn:

- 6 months × ~$80k ≈ **$480k**
- 9 months × ~$80k ≈ **$720k**

**Runway midpoint target:** **$600k**

### 2.4 Total Capital Target

Adding midpoints:

- CapEx: **$2.1M**
- Pre-opening: **$0.25M**
- Runway: **$0.6M**

> **Total capital target for Phoenix flagship: ≈ $2.95M**
> For investor conversations, we frame this as a **$2.7–3.0M** target range.

## 3. How Phoenix Differs from a Generic Unit
- Higher CapEx per ft² driven by flagship-grade finishes and denser play build-out.
- Higher revenue baseline modeled in `phoenix-flagship-model.csv`, above the $2.0M generic unit assumption.
- Phoenix is the validator for the franchise model; success here de-risks replication and informs unit-level guardrails.

## 4. Go / No-Go Gates for Phoenix

We will not advance franchise rollout unless Phoenix meets minimum thresholds over its first 6 months of full operation:

- **Day-pass → member conversion:**
  - Target: ≥15%
  - Alert: <10% for 6 consecutive months → revisit offering/pricing; pause expansion until conversion program is redesigned.
- **Member churn:**
  - Target: ≤5% monthly
  - Alert: >6% monthly by Month 9 → pause replication, deploy retention fixes, and revalidate before reopening franchise sales.
- **Play attendant turnover:**
  - Target: ≤35–40% annualized
  - Alert: >50% annualized → redo hiring, training, and compensation before any rollout.

Phoenix is the validator. If these gates are not met, expansion is delayed in favor of fixing unit economics and retention.
