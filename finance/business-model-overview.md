# Co.Work.Play Business Model Overview

## Concept Overview
Co.Work.Play blends coworking, specialty café, and supervised play into a single destination for parents, remote workers, and families. The concept targets households that value flexible work options and high-quality third spaces where kids are engaged while adults work or socialize.

## Revenue Streams
- Café: espresso, light food, and grab-and-go items with steady daypart traffic.
- Cowork: memberships, day passes, conference rooms, and dedicated desks.
- Events: birthday parties, buyouts, classes, and seasonal programming.

## Cost Structure
- COGS: food and beverage inputs with café margins tuned to ~35% COGS, lower COGS on cowork and events.
- Labor: baristas, kitchen, play attendants, and management; disciplined scheduling tied to traffic.
- Rent & occupancy: negotiated on high-visibility sites with family-friendly zoning.
- Core OpEx: utilities, insurance, marketing, cleaning, POS/networking, and **AI-GM** operations.

## Unit Economics Snapshot
- Mature generic unit revenue baseline: **~$2.0M/year** with ~18–20% EBITDA after fees (see `finance/co-work-play-unit-economics.md`).
- Payback target: **~3–4 years** on $1.0–$1.5M build cost once the store is stabilized.

## Flagship vs Generic Units
- Phoenix flagship (see `finance/phoenix-flagship-summary.md`) runs at a higher baseline revenue in `phoenix-flagship-model.csv` and has higher CapEx per ft².
- Generic units use the $2.0M/year mature revenue baseline and standard CapEx range.

## Role of AI-GM
- AI-GM is the operational backbone: orchestrates screens, safety cues, and staff prompts, reducing manual oversight.
- Lowers effective labor hours, enforces service standards, and keeps brand messaging consistent across franchises.
- Annual OpEx of ~**$8.2k** sits within the "Software & AI-GM Ops" line in the unit economics and is offset by labor savings.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Labor volatility: cross-training and AI-GM prompts to keep service predictable.
- Regulatory complexity: upfront permitting checklists and play-area compliance.
- Ramp risk: staged openings with clear go/no-go gates before expansion.
- Tech dependence: monitored uptime, spares, and documented recovery runbooks.
