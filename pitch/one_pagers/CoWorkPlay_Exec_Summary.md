# CoWorkPlay Executive Summary

Co.work.PLAY Cafe blends coworking, cafe hospitality, and supervised toddler play into a single destination. The Phoenix flagship will validate the operating model, calibrate pricing, and serve as the brand and training hub. A franchising program extends the concept to family-dense markets with remote/hybrid workforces.

## Highlights
- **Integrated experience:** Flexible coworking memberships, day passes, and on-demand supervised play enable parents to balance work and caregiving in one trip.
- **Validated need:** Addresses the shortage of safe, short-duration childcare, especially for remote workers with toddlers who need community and structure.
- **Modular footprint:** Three store formats (inline cafe, mid-size cowork/play, and flagship with classrooms) fit varied real estate opportunities and capex levels.
- **Compelling unit economics:** Target 12–18 month payback driven by diversified revenue (cowork, cafe, play, events) and disciplined build-out costs.
- **Franchise scalability:** Standardized training, play protocols, and curriculum support consistent quality while enabling local ownership.

## Concept & Offering
- **Coworking:** Quiet zones, phone booths, and reservable meeting rooms; memberships with storage, printing, and after-hours access.
- **Cafe:** Specialty coffee, healthy grab-and-go, and kids’ snacks designed for low prep time and strong margins.
- **Supervised play:** Staffed toddler zone with structured activities (music, sensory play, crafts) offered in 30–120 minute blocks and bookable via app.
- **Programs & events:** Parent workshops, weekend family events, and employer-sponsored “work from here” days to drive off-peak traffic.

## Market Opportunity
- Phoenix MSA has ~90k children under five with high remote/hybrid penetration; primary trade area households skew dual-income with childcare gaps.
- Competitors (traditional daycare, play gyms, and cowork-only spaces) lack combined convenience; price sensitivity is offset by time savings and productivity gains.
- Expansion focuses on metros with high family density, favorable labor pools, and abundant strip-center inventory.

## Business Model & Economics
- **Revenue mix (goal):** 30–35% cowork memberships/passes, 25–30% supervised play, 20–25% cafe, 10–15% events/room rentals.
- **Pricing:** Monthly memberships $200–$450 depending on access and play credits; play blocks $18–$32/hr; meeting rooms $20–$35/hr; cafe margin target 65% gross.
- **Utilization targets:** 60% playroom average weekday utilization by month six; 75% booth/room utilization during peak hours.
- **Labor model:** Cross-trained “Play Hosts” support check-in, safety protocols, and light F&B; baristas handle cafe throughput; site manager oversees ops and community.
- **Unit metrics:** Build-out $350k–$550k depending on format; target $900k–$1.2M year-two revenue and 20%+ location-level EBITDA.

## Flagship Launch (Phoenix)
- **Site selection:** 3,500–4,500 sq. ft. inline center near high-density residential and Class B office; ample parking and stroller-friendly ingress.
- **Pre-opening:** 8–10 week construction, 4-week soft opening with founding-member discounts and employer pilots.
- **KPIs:** Founding members (goal: 150), recurring play bookings (200+/month), NPS > 60, safety/compliance audit 100%.

## Franchise Strategy
- **Structure:** Franchise fee $40k; royalties 6%; marketing fund 2%; required pre-opening training for franchisee + manager + lead Play Host.
- **Support:** Playbook covering staffing ratios, safety/cleaning checklists, curriculum, cafe SKUs, sourcing, and local partnership playbooks.
- **Territories:** Priority to suburban nodes with 20k+ children under five within 5 miles and strong household incomes; multi-unit agreements encouraged.
- **Quality assurance:** Quarterly audits, secret-shopper program, and centralized booking/app platform with standardized UX.

## Go-to-Market
- **Brand positioning:** “Get more done—your toddler plays next door.” Emphasizes safety, productivity, and community.
- **Channels:** Paid social to parent cohorts, partnerships with employers offering hybrid stipends, influencer previews, and local mom-group ambassadorships.
- **Retention levers:** Tiered memberships with rollover play credits, referral bonuses, and curated events for milestone moments (first steps, birthdays).

## Risk & Mitigation
- **Safety/compliance:** Strict adherence to state childcare standards; background checks, CPR certification, and daily checklists; CCTV in play areas with privacy controls.
- **Labor availability:** Cross-training reduces single-role dependencies; use of part-time educators and flexible scheduling aligned to demand peaks.
- **Seasonality:** Programming calendar and corporate partnerships smooth summer/holiday dips; gift cards and camps for school breaks.
- **Franchise consistency:** Standardized training, centralized app, and auditing ensure guest experience and safety protocols remain uniform.

## Next Steps
1) Finalize Phoenix lease and design package; 2) Lock vendor agreements for play equipment, POS, and cafe supply; 3) Launch founding-member presale campaign; 4) Prepare FDD and franchise marketing kit for early partners.
